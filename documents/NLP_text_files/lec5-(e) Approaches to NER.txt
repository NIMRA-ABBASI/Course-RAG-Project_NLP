Approaches to NER

List Lookup (Gazetteers)

Pros: Simple, fast, language-independent.

Cons: Limited to known entities, no handling of variants or ambiguity.

Shallow Parsing + Contextual Rules

Uses linguistic clues: capitalization, internal word structure, and local context patterns.

Examples:

Capitalized word followed by “Forest” or “Street” → likely location.

Context phrases like “based in [Location]”.

Challenges: Ambiguous capitalization, semantic ambiguity, structural ambiguity.

Statistical and ML-based Approaches

Models like CRF, HMM, or deep learning models (LSTM, Transformer-based).

Learn from annotated corpora, use context and word features.
