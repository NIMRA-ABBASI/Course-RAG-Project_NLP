A Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) System

To understand how an NLP system works, imagine it as a four-step pipeline where human language enters one end, and machine-generated or processed language comes out the other. Each step plays a vital role in how machines handle natural language.



🔹 1. Input Language

This is the starting point. A user gives some natural language input — it could be in the form of:

Text (e.g., “What’s the weather today?”)

Voice (which is first converted to text using speech recognition)

The input is usually messy, unstructured, and full of variations, just like how people talk or write.



🔹 2. Understanding the Language

Once the language enters the system, the machine tries to understand the meaning. This step is the heart of NLP.
It involves tasks like:

Tokenization (splitting the sentence into words)

Parsing (understanding sentence structure)

Part-of-speech tagging

Named entity recognition

Sentiment detection

Semantic analysis (what the sentence actually means)

This is the "U" in NLP: Understanding.
Here, the computer is trained to read and comprehend language the way humans do.



🔹 3. Computer Processing (Reasoning and Decision-Making)

After understanding the input, the system uses logic, machine learning models, or pre-defined rules to decide what to do.

Examples:

A chatbot figures out how to respond.

A translation model determines the equivalent sentence in another language.

A search engine finds the most relevant result.

This is where the thinking or computation happens based on what the system understood.



🔹 4. Language Generation (Output)

Finally, the system generates language as output.
This output could be:

A direct response (e.g., “It’s sunny and 30°C”)

A translation (e.g., converting English to French)

A summary or a sentiment label

This is the “G” part: Generation.
The computer creates or outputs text (or speech) that is clear and meaningful for a human to understand.



📌 Example:

User: "What's the weather today?"

Input Language: User speaks or types the question.

Understanding: The system breaks the sentence into parts, identifies the question type, and understands the meaning.

Processing: It searches a weather database for today’s data.

Generation: The system replies: “The weather is sunny and 30 degrees.”
