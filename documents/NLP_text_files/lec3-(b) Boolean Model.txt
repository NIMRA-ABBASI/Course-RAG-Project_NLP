What is the Boolean Model?

The Boolean Model is a way to search documents based on whether certain keywords are present or absent in the document.

Each document is treated like a set of keywords (words that appear in it).

A user’s query is made up of keywords combined with Boolean operators like AND, OR, and NOT.

You can also use brackets to group parts of the query for clarity.



How does it work?

The system checks if the document matches the query exactly.

The output is simple: either the document is relevant (matches) or not relevant.

There is no ranking or partial matching — documents either satisfy the query or they don’t.



Why is the Boolean Model popular?

It’s easy to understand and use for simple searches.

It has a clear and formal structure.

It can be extended to add ranking if needed.

It’s efficient to implement for typical queries.
