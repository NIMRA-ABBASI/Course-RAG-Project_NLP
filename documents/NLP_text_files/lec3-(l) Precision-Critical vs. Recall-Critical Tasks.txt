Precision-Critical vs. Recall-Critical Tasks

Precision-critical tasks:

Time is limited; you want only a few, very accurate results.

It's okay to miss some relevant items as long as the returned ones are very reliable.

Example: Web search for factual info where users want quick, correct answers.

Recall-critical tasks:

Time is less important; missing relevant items is costly.

Itâ€™s better to find all relevant items, even if you get some irrelevant ones.

Example: Patent search, where missing a relevant patent could have serious consequences.
