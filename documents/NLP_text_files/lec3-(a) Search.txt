What is Search?

Search is a fundamental task where you look for information or documents that match your needs.

In NLP, search helps find relevant documents or even parts of documents — like a paragraph, section, or sentence — from a large collection.



How NLP Helps in Search

NLP techniques process the text to understand the meaning of your query and the documents, making the search more accurate.



Retrieval Models

These are methods or algorithms used to find and rank documents based on how well they match the user’s query. They help identify the most relevant documents quickly.
