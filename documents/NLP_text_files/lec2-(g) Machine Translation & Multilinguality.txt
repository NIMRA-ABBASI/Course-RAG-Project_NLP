What is Machine Translation (MT)?

Machine Translation is the automatic process of converting text from one natural language (like English) into another language (like Portuguese or French).



Key Challenges in Machine Translation

Lexical Ambiguity:
A word can have multiple meanings. For example, the English word “bank” could mean a financial institution or the side of a river. The correct translation depends on the context.

Syntactic Ambiguity:
Sentence structure can be unclear or complex, causing different possible interpretations and translations.

Because of these challenges, the system needs to understand the correct meaning and structure to provide an accurate translation.



Real-World Example: Google Translate

You enter “Hello, how are you?” in English.

Google Translate converts it into “Olá, como vai?” in Portuguese.

This shows a simple, direct translation from one language to another.



Advanced Example: DeepL Translator

DeepL also translates “Hello, how are you?” to “Olá, como estás?” in Portuguese.

It offers extra features like:

Choosing between Formal or Informal tone.

Providing alternative translations.

This makes DeepL more nuanced and flexible than basic translation tools, adapting translations to the situation or style.



Simple Example of Ambiguity

English:
“He saw the bat.”

Possible Translations in another language:

Bat (animal)

Bat (baseball equipment)

The system must decide which meaning fits the sentence to translate correctly.
