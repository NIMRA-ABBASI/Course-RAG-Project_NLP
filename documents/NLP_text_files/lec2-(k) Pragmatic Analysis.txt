What is Pragmatic Analysis?

Pragmatic Analysis uses real-world knowledge and context to understand the actual meaning or intent behind a sentence.

It helps decide things like whether a sentence is a request, a command, or a question.

Example:
“Give me the pencil.”

Could be a polite request or a strict order, depending on context.
