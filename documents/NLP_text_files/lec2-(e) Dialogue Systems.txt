What are Dialogue Systems?

Dialogue systems are computer programs designed to talk or interact with humans in ways both can understand. These interactions can happen through:

Speech (voice assistants like Siri or Alexa)

Text (chatbots on websites, messaging apps)

Gestures or graphics (like virtual avatars)

Other sensory methods (haptics, animations, etc.)



Examples of Dialogue Systems:

ChatGPT — A popular AI chatbot that answers questions and holds conversations in natural language.

Gemini — An example of a modern conversational AI system.



Role of Generative AI in Dialogue Systems

Generative AI is crucial because it helps create new, meaningful content based on the input it receives. This means:

If you type or say something, the system can generate relevant responses or content.

It can create text, images, sounds, animations, 3D models, and more.

For example, you can ask ChatGPT to write a poem, generate a story, or explain a concept — all using generative AI.



Simple Example Interaction:

User: "What’s the weather like today?"
Dialogue System: "It’s sunny and 25°C in your area."
