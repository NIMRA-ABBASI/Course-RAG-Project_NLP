Why is Recall Hard to Determine?

Recall calculation requires knowing the total number of relevant items in the entire dataset, which may not be available in real life. Two common ways to estimate this are:

Taking a random sample from the dataset and having experts label what is relevant.

Using multiple retrieval systems to find relevant items and combining their results as an estimate of all relevant items.
