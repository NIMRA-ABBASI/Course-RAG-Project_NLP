What is Sentiment?

Sentiment means the positive, negative, or neutral feeling or attitude a writer shows toward something.

For example:

A movie review might say, “The film was amazing!” (positive sentiment) or “The movie was boring.” (negative sentiment).

A political editorial might express support or criticism for a candidate or policy.



What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is the process of using computers to read and understand digital text (like reviews, tweets, or articles) and decide whether the writer’s attitude is:

Positive (happy, supportive)

Negative (angry, critical)

Neutral (neutral or no strong feeling)



Simple Example

Text: “I love this phone; the battery lasts all day!”
Sentiment: Positive

Text: “The service was terrible and the food was cold.”
Sentiment: Negative
