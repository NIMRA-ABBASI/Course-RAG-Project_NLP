Why is NLP Important?

Human-Centered Communication
Most human knowledge is stored and shared through language. NLP enables computers to access, analyze, and generate this information.

Massive Text Data Everywhere
With billions of emails, social media posts, websites, and documents being created daily, NLP helps in managing and making sense of this data.

Bridges the Gap Between Humans and Machines
Instead of learning programming languages to talk to machines, NLP allows us to use our own language.

Essential in AI Applications
NLP powers chatbots, translation tools, voice assistants, sentiment analysis, and more.
