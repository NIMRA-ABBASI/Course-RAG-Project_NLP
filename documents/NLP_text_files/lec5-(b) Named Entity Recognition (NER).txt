Named Entity Recognition (NER) — Detailed Overview

What is NER?

NER is a fundamental sub-task of Information Extraction (IE) that identifies and classifies proper names (entities) in text.

Entities are classified into predefined categories like person, location, organization, and others.

It does not identify events or relations — only entities themselves.

It’s more than just matching against lists — it involves linguistic and contextual understanding.



Common Categories in NER

Person: Names of people (e.g., Andrew Wilkie)

Organization: Companies, parties, institutions (e.g., Labor, Greens)

Location: Geographic names (cities, countries)

Date/Time: Dates, years (e.g., 2010)

Others: Measures, email addresses, domain-specific entities like drug names, ships, etc
