What is Text Summarization?

Text summarization is the process of creating a short, clear, and accurate summary from a longer text. It helps you quickly understand the main points without reading the entire document.

For example, search engines show short summaries (called snippets) under each search result to give you a quick idea of what the page is about.



Real-World Example: Web Search Summarization

When you search for “generative AI” on Google, you see a list of links. Under each link, there’s a short summary — a snippet taken from the web page. These snippets help you decide which link to click by showing key information in a few sentences.



Types of Summarization

Extractive Summarization

Picks important sentences or phrases directly from the original text.

Example: Taking every 3rd or 4th sentence from a paragraph to form the summary.

It’s like highlighting key sentences.

Abstractive Summarization

Understands the main ideas and rewrites them in simpler, shorter language.

The summary may use new sentences or words not found exactly in the original text.

Similar to how humans write summaries by paraphrasing.



Simple Example

Original Text:
“Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content like text, images, or music. These systems learn patterns from data and generate creative outputs.”

Extractive Summary:
“Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content like text, images, or music.”

Abstractive Summary:
“Generative AI creates new content by learning from existing data.”
