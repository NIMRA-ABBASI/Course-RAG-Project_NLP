What is Discourse Analysis?

Discourse Analysis studies how sentences connect and influence each other in a larger context like a paragraph or full document.

It looks beyond a single sentence to understand meaning based on what was said before.

Example:
Sentence 1: “John didn’t come to work.”
Sentence 2: “He was sick.”
Sentence 2 makes more sense when we know Sentence 1.
