Evaluation Metrics for NER

Precision: Correct entities found / all entities found

Recall: Correct entities found / all entities that should be found

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Boundary errors matter a lot:

Partial matches count as false positives and false negatives.

This makes evaluation more complex compared to other IR tasks.
