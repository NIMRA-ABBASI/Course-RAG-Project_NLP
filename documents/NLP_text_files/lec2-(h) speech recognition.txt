What is Speech Recognition?

Speech Recognition (also called Automatic Speech Recognition or ASR) is a technology that converts spoken language (human speech) into written text.

It allows computers and applications to understand and process what people say.



Opposite Technology: Speech Synthesis (Text-to-Speech)

Speech Synthesis or Text-to-Speech (TTS) does the opposite — it converts written text into spoken words (an audio waveform).

For example, when your phone reads out a message aloud, it uses speech synthesis.



How Speech Recognition Works (Simple Explanation)

When you speak, your voice produces sound waves (audio waveform).

The speech recognition system processes these sound waves to identify words and convert them into text.

This text can then be used by computers to perform tasks like sending messages, searching the web, or controlling devices.



Example Applications of Speech Recognition

Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant

Transcription Services: Converting meeting recordings to text

Voice Commands: Controlling phones, cars, or smart home devices

Customer Support: Automated phone systems understanding spoken requests



Conceptual Visual

Imagine a graph showing a wavy line — this represents the sound waves of your speech. Speech recognition systems analyze these waves to understand and write down your spoken words.
