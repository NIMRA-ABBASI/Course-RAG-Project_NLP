Challenges in NER

Ambiguity: Same word/entity may refer to different categories depending on context.

Example: Washington (person or location)

May (person or month)

Metonymy (one entity name used for related things):

"The ham sandwich wants his bill" (person, not food)

"West Indies won the World Cup" (team = organization vs. place)

Entity variation: Different forms of the same entity (John Smith, J. Smith)

Boundary detection: Correctly determining start/end of multi-word entities.

Domain and genre variability: Formal vs. informal text, punctuation, formatting affect detection.
