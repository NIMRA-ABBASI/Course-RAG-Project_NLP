Precision vs. Recall

Precision is the percentage of selected items that are actually correct.
Example: Out of all the emails your spam filter marked as spam, what fraction truly were spam?

Recall is the percentage of correct items that are successfully selected.
Example: Out of all the actual spam emails in your inbox, what fraction did the filter catch?

These two metrics have an inverse relationship:

When you try to increase recall (catch more relevant items), precision often drops because you include more irrelevant items too.

When you try to increase precision (be more selective), recall may drop because you miss some relevant items.



Trade-off Between Precision and Recall (Precision-Recall Curve)

Imagine a graph where the x-axis is recall (from 0 to 1) and the y-axis is precision (also 0 to 1):

In the top-left corner (high precision, low recall), the system returns only highly relevant results but misses many useful ones. It’s very careful but may overlook many positives.

In the bottom-right corner (low precision, high recall), the system finds most relevant items but includes a lot of irrelevant ones too — so it returns “junk” along with the good stuff.

The ideal point is the top-right corner (precision = 1, recall = 1), meaning the system finds all relevant items and nothing irrelevant, but this is very hard to achieve.

This curve shows the typical trade-off between these two metrics.
