Madinah and its suburbs, after the ratification of this treaty, turned into a coalition 
state, with Madinah proper as capital and Muhammad [pbuh] as ‘president’; 
authorities lay mainly in the hand of the Muslims, and consequently it was a real 
capital of Islam. To expand the zone of peace and security the Prophet [pbuh] 
started to enter into similar treaties with other tribes living around ‘his state’.

The Prophet on the Battlefield 
The Quraishites, mortified at the escape of the Prophet [pbuh] along with his 
devoted companions, and jealous of his growing power in Madinah, kept a stringent 
watch over the Muslims left behind and persecuted them in every possible way. They 
also initiated clandestine contacts with ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, chief of Madinese 
polytheists, and president designate of the tribes ‘Aws and Khazraj before the 
Prophet’s emigration. They sent him a strongly-worded ultimatum ordering him to 
fight or expel the Prophet, otherwise they would launch a widespread military 
campaign that would exterminate his people and proscribe his women. [Narrated by Abu 
Da'ud] 
His pride wounded and kingship no longer his, ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, a priori 
responded positively to his Quraishite co-polytheists. He mobilized his supporters to 
counteract the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] on hearing about this unholy alliance, 
summoned ‘Abdullah and admonished him to be more sensible and thoughtful and 
cautioned his men against being snared in malicious tricks. [Narrated by Abu Da'ud] The 
men, on grounds of cowardice, or reason, gave up the idea. Their chief, however, 
seemingly complied, but at heart, he remained a wicked unpredictable accomplice 
with Quraish and the envious Jews. Skirmishes and provocations started to pave the 
way for a major confrontation between the Muslims and polytheists. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, 
an outstanding Helper, announced his intention to observe ‘Umrah (lesser 
pilgrimage) and headed for Makkah. There Omaiya bin Khalaf provided tutelage for 
him to observe the ritual circumambulation. Abu Jahl, an archenemy of Islam saw 
him in the Sacred Sanctuary and threatened he would have killed him if he had not 
been in the company of Omaiya. Sa‘d, fearlessly and defiantly, challenged him to 
committing any folly at the risk of cutting their caravans off.[Bukhari 2/563] 
Provocative actions continued and Quraish sent the Muslims a note threatening to 
put them to death in their own homeland. Those were not mere words, for the 
Prophet [pbuh] received information from reliable sources attesting to real intrigues 
and plots being hatched by the enemies of Islam. Precautionary measures were 
taken and a state of alertness was called for, including the positioning of security 
guards around the house of the Prophet [pbuh] and strategic junctures. ‘Aishah [R] 
reported that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] lay down on bed during one night on his 
arrival in Madinah and said: Were there a pious person from amongst my 
Companions who should keep a watch for me during the night? She (‘Aishah [R]) 
said: We were in this state when we heard the clanging noise of arms. He (the 
Prophet [pbuh]) said: Who is it? He said: This is Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas. Allâh’s 
Messenger [pbuh] said to him: What brings you here? Thereupon he said: I 
harboured fear (lest any harm should come to) Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh], so I came 
to serve as your sentinel. Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] invoked blessings upon him and 
then he slept.[Muslim 2/280; Bukhari 1/404]
