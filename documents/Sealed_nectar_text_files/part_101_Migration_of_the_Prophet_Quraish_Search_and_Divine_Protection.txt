The assassins who laid siege to the house were waiting for the zero hour when 
someone came and informed them that the Prophet [pbuh] had already left. They 
rushed in and to their utter surprise, found that the person lying in the Prophet’s bed

was ‘Ali not Muhammad [pbuh]. This created a stir in the whole town. The Prophet 
[pbuh] had thus left his house on Safar 27th, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, 
i.e. 12/13 September 622 A.D.[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/95] 
Knowing already that Quraish would mobilize all its potentials to find him, he played 
a clever trick on them and instead of taking the road to Madinah in north side of 
Makkah as the polythiest would expect, he walked along a road least expected lying 
south of Makkah and leading to Yemen. He walked for 5 miles until he reached a 
rough rocky mountain called Thawr. There his shoes were worn out, some said he 
used to walk tiptoe in order not to leave a trail behind him. Abu Bakr [R] carried him 
up the mountain to a cave called after the name of the mountain, Cave Thawr. Abu 
Bakr first entered to explore the cave and be sure that it was safe, closed all holes 
with pieces torn off from his clothes, cleaned it and then asked the Prophet [pbuh] to 
step in. The Prophet [pbuh] went in and immediately laid his head in Abu Bakr’s lap 
and fell asleep. Suddenly Abu Bakr’s foot was stung by a poisonous insect. It hurt so 
much that his tears fell on the Prophet’s face. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately 
applied his saliva on Abu Bakr’s foot and the pain went off on the spot. They confined 
themselves to this cave for three nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. ‘Abdullah, the 
son of Abu Bakr would go to see them after dusk, stay the night there, apprise them 
of the latest situation in Makkah, and then leave in the early morning to mix with the 
Makkans as usual and not to draw the least attention to his clandestine activities. 
‘Amir bin Fuhairah, while in the company of other shepherds of Makkah tending his 
master Abu Bakr’s flock, used to stole away unobserved every evening with a few 
goats to the cave and furnished its inmates with a plentiful supply of milk.[Bukhari 1/553; 
Ibn Hisham 1/486] 
Quraish, on the other hand, were quite baffled and exasperated when the news of 
the escape of the two companions was confirmed. They brought ‘Ali to Al-Ka‘bah, 
beat him brutally and confined him there for an hour attempting desperately to make 
him divulge the secret of the disappearance of the two ‘fugitives’, but to no avail. 
They then went to see Asma’, Abu Bakr’s daughter, but here also their attempts 
went in vain. While at her door Abu Jahl slapped the girl so severely that her earring 
broke up.[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/96; Ibn Hisham 1/487] 
The notables of Makkah convened an emergency session to determine the future 
course of action and explore all areas that could help arrest the two men. They 
decided to block all avenues leading out of Makkah and imposed heavy armed 
surveillance over all potential exits. A price of 100 camels was set upon the head of 
each one.[Bukhari 1/554] Horsemen, infantry and tracers of tracks scoured the country. 
Once they even reached the mouth of the cave where the Prophet [pbuh] and Abu 
Bakr were hiding. When he saw the enemy at a very close distance, Abu Bakr 
whispered to the Prophet [pbuh]: "What, if they were to look through the crevice and 
detect us?" The Prophet [pbuh] in his God-inspired calm replied: 
"Silence Abu Bakr! What do you think of those two with whom the Third is 
Allâh."[Bukhari 1/516; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.168] 
It was really a Divine miracle, the chasers were only a few steps from the cave.
