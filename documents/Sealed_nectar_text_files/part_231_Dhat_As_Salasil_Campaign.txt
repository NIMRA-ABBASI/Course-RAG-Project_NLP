sil Campaign 
Dhat As-Salasil is a spot situated ten days’ walk north of Madinah. The Muslims are 
said to have encamped in a place with a well of water called Salsal, hence the 
terminology Dhat As-Salasil. In view of the alliance between the Arabian tribes on 
the borders of Syria and the Byzantines, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it of top

The Muslim army reached the habitations of Quda‘a and penetrated deep in their
