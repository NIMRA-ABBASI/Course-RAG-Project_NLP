The Prophetic Family 
The family of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] is called the Hashimite family after his 
grandfather Hashim bin ‘Abd Munaf. Let us now speak a little about Hashim and his 
descendants:  
1. Hashim: As we have previously mentioned, he was the one responsible for 
giving food and water to the pilgrims. This had been his charge when the sons 
of ‘Abd Munaf and those of ‘Abd Ad-Dar compromised on dividing the charges 
between them. Hashim was wealthy and honest. He was the first to offer the 
pilgrims sopped bread in broth. His first name was ‘Amr but he was called 
Hashim because he had been in the practice of crumbling bread (for the 
pilgrims). He was also the first man who started Quraish’s two journeys of 
summer and winter. It was reported that he went to Syria as a merchant. In 
Madinah, he married Salma — the daughter of ‘Amr from Bani ‘Adi bin An-
Najjar. He spent some time with her in Madinah then he left for Syria again 
while she was pregnant. He died in Ghazza in Palestine in 497 A.D. Later, his 
wife gave birth to ‘Abdul-Muttalib and named him Shaiba for the white hair in

his head,[Ibn Hisham 1/137; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 1/26,2/24] and brought 
him up in her father’s house in Madinah. None of his family in Makkah learned 
of his birth. Hashim had four sons; Asad, Abu Saifi, Nadla and ‘Abdul-
Muttalib, and five daughters Ash-Shifa, Khalid
