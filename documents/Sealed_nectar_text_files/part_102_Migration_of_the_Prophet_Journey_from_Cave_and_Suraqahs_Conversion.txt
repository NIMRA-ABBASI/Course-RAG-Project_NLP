Someone called ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit, who had as yet not embraced Islam, but was 
trusted by Abu Bakr, and had been hired by him as a guide, reached the cave after 
three nights according to a plan bringing with him Abu Bakr’s two camels. His report 
satisfied the noble ‘fugitives’ that the search had slackened. The opportunity to 
depart was come. Here Abu Bakr offered the Prophet [pbuh] the swift animal to ride 
on. The latter agreed provided that he would pay its price. They took with them the 
food provisions that Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, brought and tied in a bundle of 
her waistband, after tearing it into two parts, hence the appellation attached to her: 
"Asma’ of the two waistbands." The Prophet [pbuh], Abu Bakr and ‘Amir bin Fuhairah 
departed, and their guide ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit led them on hardly ever trodden 
ways along the coastal route. That was in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, 1st year A.H., i.e. 
September 622 A.D. The little caravan travelled through many villages on their way 
to Quba’. In this context, it is relevant to introduce some interesting incidents that 
featured their wearying journey: 
1. One day they could find no shelter from the scorching heat so Abu Bakr [R] 
cast a glance and found a little shade beside a rock. He cleaned the ground, 
spread his mantle for the Prophet [pbuh] to lie on and himself went off in 
search of food. He came across a shepherd, a bedouin boy, who was also 
seeking a shelter. Abu Bakr asked him for some milk and took it to the 
Prophet [pbuh], cooled it with some water and waited till the Prophet [pbuh] 
woke up and quenched his thirst.[Bukhari 1/510]  
2. Whoever asked Abu Bakr [R] about the identity of his honourable companion, 
he would reply that he was a man who guided him on his way. The questioner 
would think that Muhammad [pbuh] was a guide, in terms of roads, whereas 
Abu Bakr used to mean guide to the way of righteousness.[Bukhari 1/556]  
3. Quraish, as we have already mentioned, had declared that whoever would 
seize Muhammad [pbuh] would receive a hundred camels as reward. This had 
spurred many persons to try their luck. Among those who were on the 
lookout for the Prophet [pbuh] and his companion in order to win the reward 
was Suraqah, the son of Malik. He, on receiving information that a party of 
four, had been spotted on a certain route, decided to pursue it secretly so 
that he alone should be the winner of the reward. He mounted a swift horse 
and went in hot pursuit of them. On the way the horse stumbled and he fell 
on the ground. On drawing a lot so as to divine whether he should continue 
the chase or not, as the Arabs used to do in such circumstances, he found the 
omens unpropitious. But the lust for material wealth blinded him altogether 
and he resumed the chase. Once more he met with the same fate but paid no 
heed to it. Again he jumped onto the saddle and galloped at a break-neck 
speed till he came quite close to the Prophet [pbuh]. Abu Bakr’s heart 
agitated and he kept looking back while the Prophet [pbuh] remained 
steadfast and continued reciting verses of the Qur’ân.  
The repeated stumbling of Suraqah’s horse and his falling off awakened him 
to the situation, and he realized that it was a constant warning of Allâh for his 
evil design which he contemplated against the Prophet [pbuh]. He approached 
the travelling group with a penitent heart and begged of the Prophet [pbuh] 
forgiveness in all humility. He addressed the Prophet [pbuh] and his 
companion, saying: "Your people (the Quraishites) have promised a generous 
reward to anyone who captures you." He added that he offered them 
provision but they declined his offer. They only asked him to screen off their 
departure and blind the polytheists to their hiding place. Then the Prophet

[pbuh] forgave him and confirmed it with a token written by ‘Amir bin 
Fuhairah on a piece of parchment. Suraqah hurried back to Makkah and tried 
to foil the attempts of those who were in pursuit of Muhammad [pbuh] and 
his n
