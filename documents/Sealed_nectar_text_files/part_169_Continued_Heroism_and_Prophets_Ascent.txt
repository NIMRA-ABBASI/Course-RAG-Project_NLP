rd moments of that day, a group of Muslim heroes gathered around 
the Prophet [pbuh] forming a shield to protect him from the idolaters. Some of them 
were Abu Dujana, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Sahl bin Haneef, Malik bin — 
Sinan the father of Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudri, Umm‘Amara, Nusaiba bint Ka‘b Al-Mâziniya, 
Qatada bin An-Nu‘man, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, Hatib bin Abi Balta‘a and Abu Talha. 
The number of idolaters was steadily increasing; and their attacks, naturally, got 
severer. Their press had increased to an extent that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
fell into one of the holes dug and designed by Abu ‘Amir Al-Fasiq to be used as traps. 
His knee scratched and ‘Ali helped him by grasping his hand up. Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh 
took him in his lap till he could stand upright. Nafi‘ bin Jubair said: I heard an 
Emigrant say: "I have witnessed Uhud Battle and watched how arrows had been 
hurled from all directions at the Prophet [pbuh]. None of them however hit him. 
‘Abdullah, bin Shihab Az-Zuhri said: ‘Guide me to Muhammad [pbuh]! By Allâh, If I 
didn’t kill him, I would not hope to live.’ Although the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was 
next to him, alone — but he did not observe him. Safwan, a co-polytheist of his, 
blamed him (for not translating his words into deeds), but ‘Abdullah swore that he 
did not see him (the Prophet [pbuh]) and added that he might be immune to our 
attempts on his life. He also said that four of them pledged to make a fresh attempt 
and kill him, but also to no avail. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] 
The Muslims showed unprecedented rare heroism and marvellous sacrifices. Abu 
Talha — for instance — shielded the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] by his body and used 
his chest to protect him against the enemy arrows. Anas related that on Uhud Day 
when people dispersed off the Prophet [pbuh], Abu Talhah was a skillful sort of 
archer who would pull arrows so much that he broke two or three bows that day. 
When a man passed along with a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet [pbuh] would 
say: "Spread the arrows to Abu Talhah!" Then when the Prophet [pbuh] watched 

173
people shooting, Abu Talhah would say: "I sacrifice my father and mother for your 
safety. Do not go too close lest an arrow of theirs should hit you. I would rather die 
than see you hurt."[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/581] 
Abu Dujana stood before the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and used to protect him 
from the arrows by his back. Hatib bin Balta‘a followed ‘Utbah bin Abi Waqqas — who 
broke the honourable incisor (of the Prophet [pbuh]) — struck him with the sword, 
cracked his head and took his mare and sword. Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas was so keen to 
kill his brother ‘Utbah, but he could not; however, Hatib could. 
Sahl bin Haneef — a hero archer — who had pledged to die in the cause of Allâh, 
also played a prominent part in Uhud hostilities. 
The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself was involved in shooting arrows. In a version 
by Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] shot so many arrows 
that the two ends of his bow were flattened. So Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man took it to 
remain with him for good. On that day his eye was so hurt that it fell down onto his 
cheek; but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reput it in its socket with his hand and it 
became the better and the more sharp-sighted of the two. 
On that day ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf kept on fighting till his mouth was hurt and got 
broken. He sustained over twenty wounds, some in his leg, and that lamed him. 
Malik bin Sinan, the father of Abi Sa‘eed Al-Khudri sucked the blood out of the 
Prophet [pbuh]’s cheek till he cleaned it. The Prophet [pbuh] said: "Spit it!". But 
Malik said: "By Allâh, I will never spit it". Then he set out to fight. The Prophet 
[pbuh] then said: "He who wants to see a man of the people of Paradise, let him look 
at this one." No sooner had he resumed fighting than he was martyred in the thick of 
the battle. 
Umm ‘Amarah participated in the fight too. She encountered Ibn Qami’a in combat, 
and sustained a slight wound on her shoulder, but she herself also struck him with 
her sword several times but he survived because he was wearing two armours. She, 
however, went on striking until her wounds counted twelve. 
Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, in his turn, fought fiercely and violently defending the Prophet 
[pbuh] against the attacks of Ibn Qami’a and his fellows. He was carrying the 
standard with his right hand. In the process of fighting, it was cut off, so he grabbed 
the standard in his left hand till this was also amputated so he knelt down and 
shielded it with his chest and neck. Ibn Qami’a then killed him, mistaking him for the 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] on account of resemblance in appearance. Only then did 
Ibn Qami’a shout ‘Muhammad [pbuh] has been killed.’[Ibn Hisham 2/73; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] 
No sooner had Ibn Qami’a uttered that ominous sentence than consternation spread 
among Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers, and their morale was drastically reduced. 
Consequently, confusion and a miserable state of disorder prevailed amongst them. 
Whilst the rumours managed to adversely act amongst the Muslims, it alleviated the 
sharp impact of the assaults of the polytheists who came to believe that they did 
really achieve their final objective and so they turned towards mutilating the dead 
bodies.

When Mus‘ab was killed, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] delivered the standard to ‘Ali 
bin Abi Talib. ‘Ali, in conjunction with the other Companions, went on fighting bravely 
and set marvellous examples of heroism, courage and endurance in both defence 
and attack. 
Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] made his way to his encircled army. Ka‘b bin 
Malik, who was the first one to recognize the approaching Prophet [pbuh], shouted 
as loudly as he could: "O folks of Muslims, be cherished! The Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] is here." But the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] signed to him to stop lest his 
position should be located by the idolaters. Upon hearing the shout, the Muslims 
immediately raced towards the source of the shout which brought about thirty 
Companions to gather around the Prophet [pbuh]. With this assembled number of his 
Companions, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started drawing a planned withdrawal to 
the hillocks nearby. 
Hostilities of the enemy grew fiercer than ever with the aim of foiling the plan of 
withdrawal of the Muslims. Their attempts however proved to be fruitless due to the 
heroic steadfastness of the lions of Islam. 
‘Uthman bin ‘Abdullah bin Al-Mugheerah — one of the enemy horsemen — 
progressed towards the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] while saying: "Either I kill him 
(i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]) or I will be killed." The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] moved to 
encounter him but his mare tripped into some holes. So Al-Harith bin As-Simma 
combated with the enemy, and struck him on his leg so he went lame, then he 
finished him off, took his arm and overtook the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. 
But later on another Makkan horseman, called ‘Abdullah bin Jabir, attacked Al-Harith 
bin As-Simma, and struck him on the shoulder with his sword and he was carried to 
the camp of the Muslims suffering from serious wounds. Anyway that very idolater 
did not escape death, for Abu Dujana — the red head-banded hero and adventurer — 
struck him heavily and cut his head off. 
During this bitter fight, a desire to sleep overwhelmed the Muslims — that was a 
security and tranquillity to help His slave Muslims as the Qur’ân spoke in this 
context. Abu Talhah said: "I was one of those who were possessed by a desire to 
sleep on Uhud Day. On that day my sword fell off my hand several times. Again and 
again it fell down and again and again I picked it up."[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/582] 
In a regular withdrawal and with great bravery and boldness, the Muslims finally 
retreated to the cover of Mountain Uhud. Then, the rest of the army followed them to 
that safe position. In this manner, the ge
