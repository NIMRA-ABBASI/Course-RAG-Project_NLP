The Companions’ concern over the Prophet’s Death 
The great (loss) news was soon known by everybody in Madinah. Dark grief spread 
on all areas and horizons of Madinah. Anas said: 
"I have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] came to us; and I have never witnessed a more 
awful or darker day than that one on which the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
died on." [Mishkat-ul-Masabih 2/547] 
When he died, Fatimah said: "O Father, whom his Lord responded to his 
supplication! O Father, whose abode is Paradise. O Father, whom I announce his 
death to Gabriel." [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/641]  
‘Umar’s Attitude 
‘Umar, who was so stunned that he almost lost consciousness and stood before 
people addressing them: "Some of the hypocrites claim that the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] died. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] did not die, but went to his Lord in the 
same way as Moses bin ‘Imran did. He stayed away for forty nights, but finally came 
back though they said he had been dead. By Allâh, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death." 
[Ibn Hisham 2/655] 
  Abu Bakr’s Attitude 
Abu Bakr left his house at As-Sunh and came forth to the Mosque on a mare-back. 
At the Mosque, he dismounted and entered. He talked to nobody but went on till he 
entered ‘Aishah’s abode, and went directly to where the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
was. The Prophet [pbuh] was covered with a Yemeni mantle. He uncovered his face 
and tended down, kissed him and cried. Then he said: "I sacrifice my father and 
mother for your sake. Allâh, verily, will not cause you to die twice. You have just 
experienced the death that Allâh had ordained." 
Then he went out and found ‘Umar talking to people. He said: "‘Umar, be seated." 
‘Umar refused to do so. People parted ‘Umar and came towards Abu Bakr, who 
started a speech saying: 
"And now, he who worships Muhammad [pbuh]. Muhammad is dead now. 
But he who worships Allâh, He is Ever Living and He never dies. Allâh says: 

310
‘Muhammad ([pbuh])is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) 
Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you 
then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on 
his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allâh, and Allâh will give reward 
to those who are grateful.’" [Al-Qur'an 3:144] 
Ibn ‘Abbas said: "By Allâh, it sounded as if people had never heard such a Qur’ânic 
verse till Abu Bakr recited it as a reminder. So people started reciting it till there was 
no man who did not recite it." 
Ibn Al-Musaiyab said that ‘Umar had said: "By Allâh, as soon as I heard Abu Bakr 
say it, I fell down to the ground. I felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so I 
collapsed when I heard him say it. Only then did I reali
