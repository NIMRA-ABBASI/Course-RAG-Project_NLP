The Prophet [pbuh] was not dismayed at all. He persisted in his mission for the 
fulfillment of which he had been commissioned to strive despite all odds. He did not 
confine his efforts to the tribes but also conducted contacts with individuals from 
some of whom he was able to receive a favourable response. Moreover, later in the 
same season, some of them did believe in his Prophethood and entered the fold of 
Islam. The following list included some of those early converts: 

86
1. Swaid bin Samit. He was an intelligent discreet poet from Yathrib 
(Madinah). During his stay in Makkah for pilgrimage (or lesser pilgrimage), he 
encountered the Prophet [pbuh] who invited him to embrace Islam. At this 
invitation, Swaid imparted to the Prophet some sound words from Luqman’s 
wisdom. The Prophet approved of that wisdom but told the man that he had 
something far better. He recited some verses from the Qur’ân, the man 
listened meditatively and the words appealed to his originally pure nature and 
accepted Islam as his faith at once. He was killed in the battle of Bu‘ath. That 
was in the eleventh year of the Prophethood. [Ibn Hisham 1/425; Rahmat-al-
lil'alameen 1/74] 
2. Eyas bin Mu‘adh. He was still a youth from Aws tribe. He came as a member 
of delegation seeking alliance with Quraish against another rival tribe dwelling 
in Madinah, Al-Khazraj. The Prophet [pbuh] met them and advised them to 
follow a better course than that they had in mind. He introduced himself and 
Islam to them, apprised them of his mission and narrated some verses from 
the Noble Qur’ân. Eyas’s heart immediately absorbed the Divine Message and 
agreed with the Prophet [pbuh]. Abul Haisar Anas bin Rafi‘, a member of the 
delegation disapproved of the boy’s behaviour and silenced him by hurling 
some dust into his face. The people then left Madinah after having failed in 
establishing alliance with Quraish. Shor
