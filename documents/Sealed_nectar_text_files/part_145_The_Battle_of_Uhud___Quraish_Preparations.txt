The Battle of Uhud 
The defeat at Badr was an ignominy which the Quraishites pride could not leave 
unavenged. Revenge was, therefore, the catchword all over Makkah. The Makkans 
even forbade lamenting over their murdered people, or ransoming their captives at 
Badr Battle lest the Muslims should realize the grave degree of sadness and feeling 
of tragedy they were experiencing. 
In the wake of Badr event, Quraish was in common consent and started fresh 
preparations to launch an overall war against the Muslims in order to restore their 
blemished prestige and wounded pride. The most enthusiastic polytheists desiring to 
go into a new battle were ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Omaiyah, Abu Sufyan bin 
Harb, and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a. They were determined to crush the 
commonwealth of Islam once and for all. Emissaries were sent to all the tribes to 
make common cause against the rising Faith. As a consequence of this, they 
managed to enlist the support of two well-known tribes Kinana and Tihamah besides 
some desert bedouins Ahabish. It was also decided that the profits of the escaped 
caravan headed by Abu Sufyan, which amounted to 1000 camels and 50 thousand 
Dinars, should be devoted for providing equipment to the army. T
