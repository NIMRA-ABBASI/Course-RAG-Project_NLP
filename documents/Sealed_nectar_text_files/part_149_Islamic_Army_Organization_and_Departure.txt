ividing the Islamic Army into Phalanxes and Departure to the Battle-field 
Ascending the pulpit at the Friday congregational prayer, the Prophet [pbuh] urged 
the people in his sermon to fight courageously. "If you remain steadfast," he said 
"you will be helped by the Power of the All- Mighty." Then he commanded his men to 
make ready for the battle. Most of them rejoiced greatly. 
He led the afternoon prayer with crowds of people. Then he entered his house 
accompanied by his two friends Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. They helped him dress and 
wear his headcloth. He armed himself and wore two armours one over the other. He 
wore his sword and went out to meet people. 
People were waiting for him impatiently. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Usaid bin Hudair 
blamed people for pressing on the Prophet [pbuh]. They said: "You have forced the 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to fight the enemy outside Madinah." Therefore they were 
determined to leave the whole matter to the Prophet [pbuh], and blamed themselves 
for what they had already done. When the Prophet [pbuh] came out, they said: "O 
Messenger of Allâh, we should have not disagreed with you. So, you are free to do 
what you desire. If you prefer to stay inside Madinah we will stay with you. Upon this 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: "It does not become a Prophet that once 
he had put on armour, he should take it off, until Allâh has decided between him and 
the enemy." [Quoted by Ahmad, Nasa'i, Hakim and Ibn Ishaq] 
The Prophet [pbuh] divided his army into three battalions: 
1. Al-Muhajireen battalion, under the command of Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al-‘Abdari.  
2. Al-Ansari-Aws battalion was commanded by Usaid bin Hudair.  
3. Al-Ansari-Khazraj battalion with Al-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir to lead it.  
The army consisted of a thousand fighters; a hundred of them armoured; another 
fifty horsemen. [Al-Huda 2,92] He appointed Ibn Umm Maktum to lead the people in 
prayer in Madinah. D
