Abu Bakr [R] performs the Pilgrimage 
In the month Dhul-Qa‘dah or in Dhul-Hijjah of the very year (the ninth of Al-Hijra), 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dispatched Abu Bakr [R], the truthful, as a deputy 
prince of Al-Hajj (pilgrimage), so that he would lead the Muslims in performing of the 
pilgrimage rituals. 
Soon after the departure of the Muslims, there came a Revelation from Allâh: the 
opening passages of the Chapter 9 entitled ‘Repentance’ (Surah Tauba or Bara’a) in 
which ‘freedom from obligation’ is proclaimed from Allâh in regard to those idolatrous 
tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with 
the Prophet [pbuh]. Communication of this news went in line with the Arabian 
traditions of making public any change relating to declining conventions of blood and 
fortunes. 
‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed to make this declaration. He overtook Abu Bakr at Al-
‘Arj or Dajnan. Abu Bakr inquired whether the Prophet [pbuh] had put him in 
command or he had just been commissioned to make the announcement. "I have 
been deputed to make the proclamation only" replied ‘Ali. The two Companions then 
proceeded with the pilgrimage process. Towards the close of the rituals, on the day 
of the ritual sacrifice, ‘Ali stood at Al-Jamrah (a spot at which stones are pelted) and 
read aloud to the multitudes that thronged around him and declared quittance from 
covenants with idolaters and giving them four months’ respite to reconsider their 
position. As for the other idolaters with whom the believers had a treaty and had 
abated nothing of the Muslims’ rights nor had supported anyone against them, then 
the terms of the treaty would run valid until the duration of which expired. 
Abu Bakr then sent some Muslims to declare publicly that no disbeliever would after 
that year perform pilgrimage, nor would anyone be allowed to make the Tawaf 
(going round) of the Sacred House unclothe
