The succession of these delegations indicated the great degree of the entire 
acceptance which the Islamic Call reached. It manifested its influence and 
domination on vast areas of Arabia . The Arabs observed Al-Madinah with such a 
great respect and estimation that they could do nothing but surrender and submit to 
it. Al-Madinah had become the headquarters of all Arabia; so it was impossible to 
avoid it. We dare not say that all the Arabians were possessed and enchanted by this 
religion. There were lots of hard-hearted bedouins — among the Arabs — who 
surrendered (i.e. became Muslims) only because their master did so. Their souls 
were not sanctified yet. Their tendency to raids had been deeply rooted in their 
souls. The teachings of Islam had not crystallized their souls well yet. Accounting 
some of them the Qur’ân says: 
"The bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to 
be in ignorance of the limits (Allâh’s Commandments and His legal laws, 
etc.) which Allâh has revealed to His Messenger. And Allâh is All-Knower, 
All-Wise. And of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they 
spend (in Allâh’s cause) as a fine and watch for calamities for you, on them 
be the calamity of evil. And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower." [Al-Qur'an 
9:97,98]

The Qur’ân praised others saying: 
"And of the bedouins there are some who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, 
and look upon what they spend in Allâh’s cause as approaches to Allâh, and 
a cause of receiving the Messenger’s invocations. Indeed these are an 
approach for them. Allâh will admit them to His Mercy. Certainly Allâh is Oft-
Forgiving, Most Merciful." [Al-Qur'an 9:99] 
Those of them who were present at Makkah, Madinah and Thaqif and in many other 
areas of Al-Yemen and Al-Bahrain were different because Islam had been firmly 
rooted in their souls. Some of them were great Companions and Masters of Muslims.
