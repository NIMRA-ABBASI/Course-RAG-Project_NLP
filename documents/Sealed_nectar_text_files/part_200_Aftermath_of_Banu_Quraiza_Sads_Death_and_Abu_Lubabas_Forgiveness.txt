e had killed a Muslim warrior by 
flinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Islam 
and their lives, wealth and children were spared. As for the spoils of the war, the 
Prophet [pbuh] divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allâh’s 
injunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. 
Women captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry. For 
himself, the Prophet [pbuh] selected Rehana bint ‘Amr bin Khanaqah, manumitted 
and married her in the year 6 Hijri. She died shortly after the farewell pilgrimage and 
was buried in Al-Baqi‘[Ibn Hisham 2/245; Talqeeh Fuhum Ahl Al-Athar p.12].

After the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa‘d 
bin Mu‘adh’s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his 
supplication ‘Aishah [R] narrated, Sa‘d’s wounds began to bleed from the front part 
of his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet [pbuh] had pitched for him in 
the mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and 
watch his well-being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood 
flowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa‘d’s tent, there was the tent of 
Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from 
you? Lo! it was Sa‘d’s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/591] 
Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had said: "The Throne of the 
Compassionate shook for the death of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh.[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/536; Sahih Muslim 2/294; 
Jami' At-Tirmidhi 2/225]" When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged 
it was too light. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] retorted: 
"The angels are carrying him." 
In the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin 
Suwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him, 
and another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of ‘Ukasha, died. 
Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and 
then he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allâh the All-Forgiving 
revealed a verse to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to the effect that Allâh had turned 
to Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him but he insisted 
that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself do it. And this was done shortly before 
the morning prayer. 
This Ghazwah took place in the month of Dhul Qa‘dah in the year five Hijri[Ibn Hisham 
2/237,238; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/590,591; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/72-74; Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.287-290], and the siege of 
Banu Quraiza’s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates was revealed
