n Monday, 8th Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, i.e. September 
23rd. 622, the Messenger of Allâh arrived at Quba’.[Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/102] 
As soon as the news of Muhammad’s arrival began to spread, crowds came flocking 
out of Madinah . They would come every morning and wait eagerly for his 
appearance until forced by the unbearable heat of the midday sun to return. One day 
they had gone as usual, and after a long wait and watch they retired to the city when 
a Jew, catching a glimpse of three travellers clad in white winding their way to 
Madinah , shouted from the top of a hillock: "O you people of Arabia! Your 
grandfather has come! He, whom you have been eagerly waiting for, has come!" The 
Muslims immediately rushed holding their weapons, (to defend him)[Bukhari 1/555] 
. The joyful news soon spread through the city and people marched forward to greet 
their noble guest. 
Ibn Al-Qayyim said: "The shouts of ‘Allâhu Akbar’ (Allâh is Great) resounded in Banu 
‘Amr bin ‘Auf. Muhammad’s [pbuh] elation correspondingly increased, but with rare 
sense of timing and propriety, called a halt. Serenity enveloped him and the 
ñevelation was sent down:[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/54]  
"... then verily, Allâh is his Maula (Lord, Master or Protector), and Gabriel, 
and the righteous among the believers, - and furthermore, the angels - are 
his helpers." [Al-Qur'an 66:4][Za'
