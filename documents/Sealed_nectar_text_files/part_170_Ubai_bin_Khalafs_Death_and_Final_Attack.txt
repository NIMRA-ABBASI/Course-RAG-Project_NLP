: "When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was going up the 
hillock, he was followed by Ubai bin Khalaf who was saying: ‘Where is Muhammad 
[pbuh]? Either I kill him or I will be killed.’ The Companions of Muhammad [pbuh] 
said: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, do you mind if one of us combats with him?’ But the 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: ‘Leave him!’ So when he drew nearer, the 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] took the spear from Al-Harith bin As-Simma. He shivered 
violently in such a way that made all of them scatter in all directions violently and 
impulsively. Then he faced him, observed his clavicle through a gap between the 
wide opening of the armour and the part of his neck enclosed by. He speared him in

that spot. The effect of the stroke was so strong that it made him roll off his horse 
over and over. When he returned to Quraish, they found that he had only had a 
small scratch in his neck. So when blood became congested he said: ‘By Allâh, 
Muhammad has killed me.’ Hearing him say so, they said: ‘By Allâh you are afraid to 
death. By Allâh, you are possessed by a devil.’ He replied: ‘He had already told me 
when we were in Makkah: ‘I will kill you.’ By Allâh, had he spate on me, he would 
have killed me.’ Eventually, the enemy of Allâh breathed his last at a place called 
Sarif, while they were taking him back to Makkah."[Ibn Hisham 2/84; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] In a 
version by Abul-Aswad, on the authority of ‘Urwa: He was lowing like a bull and 
saying: "By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if (the pain) I am suffering from now 
were distributed among the people of Al-Majaz, it would cause them to die."[Mukhtasar 
Seerat Ar-Rasool p.250] 
During the withdrawal of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] up to the cover of the 
mountain, a big rock blocked his way. The Prophet [pbuh] tried to mount it, but 
having worn a short heavy armour, and being seriously wounded — he could not 
ascend it. Readily enough Talha sat in a position that enabled the Prophet [pbuh] to 
stand on his back. Then he lifted him up till he stood on it. The Prophet [pbuh] then 
said: "Talha, after this job, is eligible for the Garden (Paradise)."[Ibn Hisham 2/86] 
When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] settled down in his head quarters in the hillock, 
the idolaters started their last attack upon the Muslims. Ibn Ishaq related that: 
"While the Prophet [pbuh] was on the way to the hillock, a group of Quraishite elite 
ascended the mountain. They were led by Khalid bin Al-Waleed and Abu Sufyan. So 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implored his Lord saying: ‘O Allâh, they (i.e. the 
idolaters) should not be higher (i.e. in position or in power) than us (i.e. the 
Muslims). Therefore ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab and some of the Emigrants fought the 
idolaters till they drove them down the mountain.[Ibn Hisham 2/86] 
In Al-Maghazi — a book by Al-Umawi — it is stated that the idolaters went up the 
mountain. So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to Sa‘d: "Drive them off." "How can 
I drive them off by myself (i.e. without anyone to assist)." But the Messenger of 
Allâh [pbuh] repeated the phrase three times. Sa‘d then took an arrow out of his 
quiver, shot it at one of them and killed him. He said: "Then I took another one I 
know (to be good) and I shot with it another man. Then I took a third I know and 
killed a third one. Consequently they climbed down the mountain. I said to myself, 
‘this must be a blessed arrow.’ I put it in my quiver." He kept it with him till he died. 
His children kept it with th
