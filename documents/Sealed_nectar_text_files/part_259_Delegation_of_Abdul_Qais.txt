1. The delegation of ‘Abdul Qais: This tribe had two arrivals. The first was in 
the fifth year of Al-Hijra or before that date. Munqidh bin Haiyan, a member 
of that tribe, used to trade in Madinah. So, as soon as he heard of Islam when 
he had arrived in it for trading — that was after the migration — he embraced 
Islam and carried a pledge from the Prophet [pbuh] to his people who 
eventually became Muslims too. Thirteen or fourteen of them came to the 
Prophet [pbuh] in one of the Hurum Months. It was then that they asked the 
Prophet’s advice about the Faith and drinks. Their chief was Al-Ashaj Al-Usri, 
to whom the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: "You have two qualities that 
Allâh likes: They are deliberatenessandclemency."  
Their second arrival was in the Year of Delegations. They were forty men. Al-
Jarud bin Al-‘Alâ’ Al-‘Abdi, who was Christian but turned to be a good Muslim, 
was one of that group
