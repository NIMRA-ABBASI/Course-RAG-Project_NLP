Bahira, the Monk 
When the Messenger of All?  [pbuh] was twelve years old, he went with his uncle 
Abu Talib on a business journey to Syria. When they reached Busra (which was a 
part of Syria, in the vicinity of Howran under the Roman domain) they met a monk 
called Bahira (his real name was Georges), who showed great kindness, and 
entertained them lavishly. He had never been in the habit of receiving or 
entertaining them before. He readily enough recognized the Prophet [pbuh] and said 
while taking his hand: "This is the master of all humans. All?  will send him with a 
Message which will be a mercy to all beings." Abu Talib asked: "How do you know 
that?" He replied: "When you appeared from the direction of ‘Aqabah, all stones and 
trees prostrated themselves, which they never do except for a Prophet. I can 
recognize him also by the seal of Prophethood which is below his shoulder, like an 
apple. We have got to learn this from our books." He also asked Abu Talib to send 
the boy back to Makkah and not to take him to Syria for fear of the Jews. Abu Talib 
obeyed and sent him back to Makkah with some of his men servants. [Ibn Hisham

The ‘Sacrilegious’ Wars 
Muhammad [pbuh] was hardly fifteen when the ‘sacrilegious’ wars — which 
continued with varying fortunes and considerable loss of human life for a number of 
years — broke out between Quraish and Banu Kinana on the one side and Qais ‘Ailan 
tribe on the other. It was thus called because the inviolables were made violable, the 
prohibited months being included. Harb bin Omaiyah, on account of his outstanding 
position and honourable descent, used to be the leader of Quraish and their allies. In 
one of those battles, the Prophet [pbuh] attended on his uncles but did not raise 
arms agai
