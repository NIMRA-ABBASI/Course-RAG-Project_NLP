arriage to Sawdah [R] in Shawwal, the tenth year of Prophethood 
The death of Khadijah left the Prophet [pbuh] lonely. The name of Sawdah was 
suggested to him for marriage which he accepted. This lady had suffered many 
hardships for the sake of Islam. She was an early convert to the Islamic Faith and it 
was by her persuasion that her husband had embraced Islam. On the second 
emigration to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), Sawdah had accompanied her husband As-Sakran 
bin â€˜Amr. He died on their way back to Makkah leaving her in a terrible state of 
destitution. She was the first woman for the Prophet [pbuh] to marry after the death 
of Khadijah. Some years later she granted her turn with the Prophet [pbuh] to her 
co-wife
