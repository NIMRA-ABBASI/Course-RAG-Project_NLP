ng to Madinah 
The Muslim army returned from Tabuk victoriously, undeceived or wronged. That 
was because Allâh had sufficed them the evils of fight. 
On the way back and at a mountain road, twelve hypocrites sought the Prophet’s life 
and that was while he was passing along that mountain road with only Ammar 
holding the rein of his she-camel and Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman driving it, at the time 
that people had already gone down into the bottom of the valley. 
The hypocrites seized that opportunity to seek the Prophet’s life. As the Messenger of 
Allâh [pbuh] and his two companions were moving along, they heard thrusts of 
people coming towards him from behind with their faces veiled. Hudhaifa, who was 
sent by the Prophet to see what was going on, saw them and stroke their mounts’ 
faces with a crook in his hand and Allâh cast fear into their hearts. They fled away 
and overtook their people.

of their intentions. So that was why Hudhaifa was called the "confidant" of the

"And they resolved that (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) which 
they were unable to carry out." [Al-Qur'an 9:74] 
When his headquarters, Madinah, began to loom at the horizon, the Prophet [pbuh] 
said: "This is a cheerful sight. This is Uhud, which is a mountain, we like it and it 
likes us." When the Madinese learnt of their arrival they set out to meet the army. 
Women, youths, youngsters and small children went out of town to celebrate their 
home-return wholeheartedly singing: 
"The full moon shone down upon us, through the traits of Al-Wada‘ 
Mountain.  
Thanks is due to us, as long as a supplicator invokes to Allâh.."
