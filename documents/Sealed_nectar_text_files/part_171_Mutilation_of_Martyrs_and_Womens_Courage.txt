That was the last attack made by the idolaters against the Prophet [pbuh]. Being 
almost certain of his death, the idolaters returned to their camp and started 
preparations to go back to Makkah. Some of them involved themselves in mutilating 
the killed Muslims, and so did their women. Women and men cut off the ears, the 
noses, the genitals of the martyrs. They even cut open their bellies. Hind bin ‘Utbah 
— for instance — ripped open the liver of Hamzah and chewed it; but finding it 
unpleasant, she spat it out. She even made the ears and noses of Muslims into 
anklets and necklaces. [Ibn Hisham 2/90]

down his hip and split it into two. When the Muslim unveiled his face, he said: 
"What about that, Ka‘b. I am Abu Dujana." [Al-Bidaya wan Nihaya 4/17] 
2. Some Muslim women came to the battlefield when the fight was over. Anas 
said: I saw ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr [R] with Umm Sulaim. Their garments were 
gathered up so I could see their anklets. They carried water bags on their 
shoulders and emptied them into the mouths of people. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/403, 
2/581] Then they would go back to f
