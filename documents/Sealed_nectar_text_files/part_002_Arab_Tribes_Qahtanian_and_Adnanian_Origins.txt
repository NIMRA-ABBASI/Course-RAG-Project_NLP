2. Pure Arabs: Who originated from the progeny of Ya‘rub bin Yashjub bin 
Qahtan. They were also called Qahtanian Arabs.  
3. Arabized Arabs: Who originated from the progeny of Ishmael. They were 
also called ‘Adnanian Arabs.  
The pure Arabs – the people of Qahtan – originally lived in Yemen and comprised 
many tribes, two of which were very famous:

b. Kahlan: The most famous of whose septs were Hamdan, Anmar, Tai’, 
Mudhhij, Kinda, Lakhm, Judham, Azd, Aws, Khazraj and the descendants of 
Jafna — the kings of old Syria.  
Kahlan septs emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian

trade under the Roman pressure and domain on both sea and land trade routes 
following Roman occupation of Egypt and Syria. 
Naturally enough, the competition between Kahlan and Himyar led to the evacuation 
of the first and the settlement of the second in Yem
