ssenger of Allâh [pbuh] emptied his quiver of arrows and said to Sa‘d bin Abi 
Waqqas: "Shoot, an arrow Sa‘d. May my father and mother be sacrified for you.[Sahih 
Al-Bukhari 1/407, 2/580, 581]" The Prophet [pbuh] had never gathered his parents except in 
the case of Sa‘d — a privilege granted to him for his efficiency.[ibid 1/407, 2/580,581] 
In a version by Jabir — authorized by An-Nasa’i — concerning the attitude of Talha 
bin ‘Ubaidullâh towards the gathering of idolaters around the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] — when there were only some Helpers with him — Jabir said: "When the 
idolaters reached him, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: ‘Who will suffice us their 
evils (i.e. fight them back)?’ Talha said: ‘I will.’" Then Jabir mentioned the advance 
of the Helpers to fight and how they were killed one after the other in a similar way 
to Muslim’s narration — "When all the Helpers were killed, Talha proceeded forward 
to fight as much as the other eleven ones did till his hand was hurt and his fingers 
were cut off. So he said: ‘Be they cut off!’ The Prophet [pbuh] said: ‘If you had said: 
In the Name of Allâh, the angels would have raised you up before the people’s very 
eyes.’" Then he said: "Allâh drove the idolaters off them."[Fath-al-Bari 7/361; An-Nasa'i 2/52,53] 
In Al-Ikleel — a book by Hakim — it is stated that Talha had sustained thirty-nine or 
thirty-five wounds, and his fingers (i.e. the forefinger and the one next to it — got 
paralyzed.[ibid 7/361] 
In a version by Qais bin Abi Hâzim — authorized by Al-Bukhari, he said: "I saw the 
hand of Talha paralyzed. That was because he protected the Prophet [pbuh] with it 
in Uhud Battle."[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/527, 2/581] 
At-Tirmidhi stated that the Prophet [pbuh] then said about Talha: "He who desires to 
see a martyr walking on the ground, let him look at Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh."[Mishkat 2/566; 
Ibn Hisham 2/86] 
Abu Da’ûd At-Tayalisi on the authority of ‘Aishah [R], said: "Whenever Uhud Day 
(i.e. battle) was mentioned, Abu Bakr used to say: ‘That was Talha’s day (i.e. 
battle)’.[Fath Al-Bari 7/361] Abu Bakr recited a verse of poetry about him: ‘O Talha bin 
‘Ubaidullâh! Paradise is due to you as water-springs are due to deer to drink out of.’ 
[Mukhtasar Tareekh Damishq, 7/82] At the awkward and most delicate circumstances, Allâh, 
Glory is to Him, sent down His invisible Help. In a version by Sa‘d — cleared and 
authorized in Sahih Al-Bukhari and Muslim — he said: "I saw the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] on Uhud Day with two men — dressed in white defending him fiercely — I 
have never seen similar to them neither before Uhud nor after it." In another 
version: "He means to say that they were Gabriel and Michael".[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/580] 
All those events happened in no time. If the Prophet [pbuh]’s elite Companions had 
realized the grave situation immediately, they would have rushed on the spot and 
would not have left him sustain these wounds. Unfortunately, they got there after 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had been wounded and six of the Helpers killed, the 
seventh was staggering under the brunt of wounds and desperately militating in 
defence of the Prophet [pbuh]. However as soon as they arrived they encircled the 
Messenger with their bodies and weapons and were alert enough to prevent the 
enemies from reaching him. The first one who returned to give help, was his 
cavemate Abu Bakr As-Siddiq [R].

In a version by ‘Aishah [R] recorded in Ibn Hibban’s Sahih, she narrated that Abu 
Bakr had said: 
"When it was Uhud Day and at the time that the Prophet [pbuh] was left behind, I 
was the first to go back and see him. Before him I saw a man fighting to shield him 
from the enemies. I said to myself: ‘I wish he were Talha. Let my father and mother 
be sacrificed for you. (O Allâh) Let him be Talha! Let my parents be sacrificed for 
you!’ On the way, I was overtaken by Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah, who was then 
moving as swiftly as a bird. We both rushed to dress the Prophet [pbuh]’s wounds. 
There we found Talha suffering from serious wounds before the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh]. The Prophet [pbuh] said: ‘See to your brother. His deed entitled him for an 
abode in Paradise.’ I noticed that two rings of the iron-ringed helmet had penetrated 
his cheek. So I set out to take them out; but Abu ‘Ubaidah demanded: ‘By Allâh, O 
Abu Bakr — I beseech you, let me do it myself.’ Fearing to hurt the Prophet [pbuh] 
he started pulling one of the two rings out very slowly and carefully with his mouth. 
Then he pulled the arrow out by his mouth, too. Consequently, his front tooth fell. 
Then I proceeded to pull the second out; but Abu ‘Ubaidah besought me to leave it: 
‘O, Abu Bakr, I adjure you by Allâh to let me do it.’ He pulled the second ring very 
slowly and carefully with his mouth — till it came out. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
said: ‘See to your brother. He has proved to be worthy of being housed in Paradise.’
