In a narration by Anas bin Malik, he said: "While the Muslims were performing the 
dawn prayer on Monday — led by Abu Bakr, they were surprised to see the

while they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully. Seeing him, Abu 
Bakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer. For he 
thought that the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to go out and pray." Anas said: "The 
Muslims, who were praying, were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured
