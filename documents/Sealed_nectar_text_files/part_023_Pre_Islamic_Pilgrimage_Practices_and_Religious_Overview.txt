er pilgrimage. 
They ordered pilgrims coming from outside Makkah to circumambulate Al-Ka‘bah in 
Quraish uniform clothes, but if they could not afford them, men were to do so in a 
state of nudity, and women with only some piece of cloth to hide their groins. All?
 
says in this concern:  
"O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), 
while praying [and going round (the Tawaf of) the Ka‘bah]. [Al-Qur'an 7:31] 
If men or women were generous enough to go round Al-Ka‘bah in their clothes, they 
had to discard them after circumambulation for good. [Bukhari 1/226; Ibn Hisham 
1/202] 
When the Makkans were in a pilgrimage consecration state, they would not enter 
their houses through the doors but through holes they used to dig in the back walls. 
They used to regard such behaviour as deeds of piety and god-fearing. This practice 
was prohibited by the Qur’? :  
"It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from 
the back but Al-Birr (is the quality of the one) who fears All? . So enter 
houses through their proper doors, and fear All?
 
that you may be 
successful." [Al-Qur'an 2:189] 
Such was the religious life in Arabia, polytheism, idolatry,
