elegation of Bani Fazarah: Upon the Messenger’s return from 
Tabuk, the delegation of Bani Fazarah came to see him. That was in the ninth 
year of Al-Hijra. The group of delegates were over ten men. They came in 
order to profess Islam and complain about the drought of their region. The 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ascended the pulpit, lifted his hands up and 
implored Allâh to send rain forth onto them and said:  
"O Allâh let rain fall down, and water Your country and animals, and 
spread Your mercy and bring to life the dead lands. O Allâh send rain 
that would be saving, comforting, and sprouting grass, and 
overwhelming vast areas sooner and later. Let it be useful rain and 
not harmful. O Allâh let it be rain of mercy and not rain of torture and 
chastisement. Let that rain not be destructive or floody. O Allâh send 
us down water and help to fight the enemies." [Za'd A
