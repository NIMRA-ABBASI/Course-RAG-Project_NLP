In Rajab[Tareekh Al-Islam 1/120], the tenth year of the Prophethood, Abu Talib fell 
ill and passed away, six months after leaving the confinement at Ash-Sh‘ib. In 
another version, Abu Talib breathed his last in Ramadan, three days prior to the 
death of Khadijah [R] . On the authority of Al-Musaiyab, when Abu Talib was on the 
death bed, the Prophet [pbuh] entered the room where he saw Abu Jahl and 
‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah. He requested his uncle: 
"My uncle, you just make a profession that there is no true god but Allâh, 
and I will bear testimony before Allâh (of your being a believer)".  
Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah addressing him said: "Abu Talib, would you 
abandon the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib?" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] constantly 
requested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same 
statement (of Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah) — till Abu Talib gave his final 
decision and he stuck to the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that 
there is no true god but Allâh. Upon this the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: 
"By Allâh, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so 
(by Allâh)". 
It was then that Allâh, the Magnificent and Glorious revealed this verse: 
"It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s 
forgiveness for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers 
in the Oneness of Allâh) even though they be of kin, after it has become 
clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a 
state of disbelief)." [Al-Qur'an 9:113] 
And it was said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]: 
"Verily! You (O Muhammad [pbuh]) guide not whom you like." [Al-Qur'an 
28:56] [Bukhari 1/548] 
It goes without saying that Abu Talib was very much attached to Muhammad [pbuh] 
. For forty years, Abu Talib had been the faithful friend — the prop of his childhood, 
the guardian of his youth and in later life a very tower of defence. The sacrifices to 
which Abu Talib exposed himself and his family for the sake of his nephew, while yet 
incredulous of his mission, stamp his character as singularly noble and unselfish. The 
Prophet [pbuh] did his best to persuade his octogenarian uncle to make profession of 
the true faith, but he remained obdurate and stuck to the paganism of his 
forefathers, and thus could not achieve complete success. Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul-
Muttalib narrated that he said to the Prophet [pbuh] "You have not been of any avail 
to your uncle (Abu Talib) (though) by Allâh, he used to protect you and get angry on 
your behalf." The Prophet [pbuh] said: "He is in a shallow fire, and had it not been
