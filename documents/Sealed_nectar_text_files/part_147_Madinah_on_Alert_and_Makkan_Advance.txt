eanwhile Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, was closely watching the military 
movements and preparations for war, and these were all included in an urgent 
message sent by him to Prophet [pbuh] who received it while he was in Qubâ’ 
Mosque. Ubai bin Ka‘b read the letter to the Prophet [pbuh], who asked him to be 
reticent with respect to its serious contents. He hurried back to Madinah, convened a 
meeting with the Helpers and Emigrants and conducted with them serious 
consultations as regards the measures to be taken. 
The whole of Madinah was put on the alert and all men were heavily armed even 
during prayer in anticipation of any emergency. A group of Helpers volunteered to 
guard the Prophet [pbuh] and kept watchful eye all night at his door, amongst whom 
there were Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, Usaid bin Hudair and Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. Lest they should 
be taken by surprise, armed groups of the Madinese began to police the entrances 
and roads leading to the city. To reconnoitre the movements of the polytheists, 
Muslim platoons began to patrol the routes for any probable enemy raids. 
The Makkan army, on the other hand, continued the march along the usual western 
road. On reaching Al-Abwâ’, Hind bint ‘Utbah, Abu Sufyan’s wife, suggested that they 
dig up the grave of the Prophet [pbuh]’s mother, but the leaders of the army refused 
to do so for fear of the consequent results. The army then followed Wadi Al-‘Aqeeq 
and turned right to encamp themselves at a place called ‘Ainain near Uhud Mountain.
