the Prophet’s predictions of Musailima came true; for when Musailima 
returned to Yamama, he kept on thinking about the Prophet [pbuh] and how 
he would be his partner. His dreams and thoughts went so far as to claim that 
he himself was a prophet. To confirm his prophecy he started uttering rhymed 
statements. He said that it was lawful to drink wine and commit adultery. He, 
however, bore witness that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]was a real Prophet. 
His people, who were fascinated by what he allowed them to do, followed him 
and made bargains with him. He grew so prominent among them that they 
called him the beneficent of Al-Yamama. He wrote to the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] saying: "I have been appointed an associate with you, so I will have a 
half and Quraish will have the other half of the people’s affairs." The 
Messenger of Allâh’s reply was a letter saying that: 
"Verily, the earth is Allâh’s. He gives it as a heritage to whom He will 
of His slaves, and the (blessed) end is for the Muttaqûn (pious)." [Al-
Qur'an 7:128] [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/31,32] 
On the authority of Ibn Mas‘ud, he says: When the two messengers of 
Musailima — Ibn An-Nawaha and Ibn Athal — came to the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh], he asked them: "Do you bear witness that I am the Messenger of

Allâh?" Their reply was "We testify that Musailima is the Messenger of Allâh." 
"I believe in Allâh and in His Messenger," said the Prophet [pbuh], "If I had 
ever thought of killing a messenger I would have killed you both." [Mishkat Al-
Masabeeh 2/347] 
Musailima’s pretence to prophethood was in the tenth year of Al-Hijra. But he 
was killed in Al-Yamama war during Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq era, in Rabi‘ Al-
Awwal, in the twelfth year of Al-Hijra. He was killed by Wahs
