Burial and Farewell Preparations to his Honourable Body 
Dispute about who would succeed him [pbuh] broke out even before having the 
Messenger of Allâh’s body prepared for burial. Lots of arguments, discussions, 
dialogues took place between the Helpers and Emigrants in the roofed passage 
(portico) of Bani Sa‘ida. Finally they acknowledged Abu Bakr [R]e as a caliph. They 
spent the whole Monday there till it was night. People were so busy with their 
arguments that it was late night — just about dawn of Tuesday — yet his blessed 
body was still lying on his bed covered with an inked-garment. He was locked in the 
room. 
On Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al-‘Abbas, 
‘Ali, Al-Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al-‘Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the 
Messenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al-‘Abbas, Al-Fadl and 
Qathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. ‘Ali 
washed him and Aws leant him against his chest. 
They shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth 
[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/169; Sahih Muslim 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in. 
A sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abu Bakr said: "I heard 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] say: ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’ So Abu 
Talhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make 
the tomb. 
People entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet [pbuh]. The first to 
pray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women 
prayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray. 
This process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes 
Wednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: "We did not know that the Prophet [pbuh] was 
being buried till we heard the sound of tools
