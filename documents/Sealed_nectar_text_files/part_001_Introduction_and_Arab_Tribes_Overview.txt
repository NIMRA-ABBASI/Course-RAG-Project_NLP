Beyond a shadow of doubt, the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) 
manifestedly represents an exhaustive embodiment of the sublime Divine Message 
that he communicated in order to deliver the human race from the swamp of 
darkness and polytheism to the paradise of light and monotheism. An image, 
authentic as well as comprehensive, of this Message is therefore only attainable 
through careful study and profound analysis of both backgrounds and issues of such 
a biography. In view of this, a whole chapter is here introduced about the nature and 
development of Arab tribes prior to Islam as well as the circumstantial environment 
that enwrapped the Prophet's mission. 
Location of the Arabs 
Linguistically, the word "Arab" means deserts and waste barren land well-nigh 
waterless and treeless. Ever since the dawn of history, the Arabian Peninsula and its 
people have been called as such. 
The Arabian Peninsula is enclosed in the west by the Red Sea and Sinai, in the east 
by the Arabian Gulf, in the south by the Arabian Sea, which is an extension of the 
Indian Ocean, and in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq. The area is estimated 
between a million and a million and a quarter square miles. 
Thanks to its geographical position, the peninsula has always maintained great 
importance.. Considering its internal setting, it is mostly deserts and sandy places, 
which has rendered it inaccessible to foreigners and invaders, and allowed its people 
complete liberty and independence through the ages, despite the presence of two 
neighbouring great empires. 
Its external setting, on the other hand, caused it to be the centre of the old world 
and provided it with sea and land links with most nations at the time. Thanks to this 
strategic position the Arabian Peninsula had become the centre for trade, culture, 
religion and art.
