The Lineage and Family of Muhammad [pbuh] 
With respect to the lineage of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], there are three versions: 
The first was authenticated by biographers and genealogists and states that 
Muhammad’s genealogy has been traced to ‘Adnan. The second is subject to 
controversies and doubt, and traces his lineage beyond ‘Adnan back to Abraham. The 
third version, with some parts definitely incorrect, traces his lineage beyond 
Abraham back to Adam [AWS]. 
After this rapid review, now ample details are believed to be necessary. 
The first part: Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib (who was called Shaiba) 
bin Hashim, (named ‘Amr) bin ‘Abd Munaf (called Al-Mugheera) bin Qusai (also called 
Zaid) bin Kilab bin Murra bin Ka‘b bin Lo’i bin Ghalib bin Fahr (who was called 
Quraish and whose tribe was called after him) bin Malik bin An-Nadr (so called Qais) 
bin Kinana bin Khuzaiman bin Mudrikah (who was called ‘Amir) bin Elias bin Mudar 
bin Nizar bin Ma‘ad bin ‘Adnan. [Ibn Hisham 1/1,2; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al-Athar, p. 
5-6; Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/11-14,52]
