n Abi Talib, and the marriage of 
his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that 
he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and 
great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known. 
Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For 
them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the 
consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights

By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to demolish or

Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-

Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the 
Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a 
short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim. 
After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, 
did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah 
and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility
