doctrine. 
No sooner did Kisra Anu Shairwan succeed Qabaz than he, due to hatred of Mazdak’s 
philosophy, killed Mazdak and many of his followers, restored Munzir to the throne of 
Heerah and gave orders to summon under arrest Harith who sought refuge with Al-
Kalb tribe where he spent the rest of his life. 
Sons of Al-Munzir bin Ma’ As-Sama’ maintained kingship a long time until An-Nu‘man 
bin Al-Munzir took over. Because of a calumny borne by Zaid bin ‘Adi Al-‘Abbadi, the 
Persian king got angry with An-Nu‘man and summoned him to his palace. An-Nu‘man 
went secretly to Hani bin Mas‘ud, chief of Shaiban tribe, and left his wealth and 
family under the latter’s protection, and then presented himself before the Persian 
king, who immediately threw him into prison where he perished. Kisra, then, 
appointed Eyas bin Qubaisa At-Ta’i as king of Heerah. Eyas was ordered to tell Hani 
bin Mas‘ud to deliver An-Nu‘man’s charge up to Kisra. No sooner than had the 
Persian king received the fanatically motivated rejection on the part of the Arab 
chief, he declared war against the tribe of Shaiban and mobilized his troops and 
warriors under the leadership of King Eyas to a place called Dhee Qar which 
witnessed a most furious battle wherein the Persians were severely routed by the 
Arabs for the first time in history. That was very soon after the birth of Prophet 
Muhammad [pbuh] eight months after Eyas bin Qubaisah’s rise to power over 
Heerah. 
After Eyas, a Persian ruler was appointed over Heerah, but in 632 A.D. the authority 
there returned to the family of Lukhm when Al-Munzir Al-Ma‘rur took over. Hardly 
had the latter’s reign lasted for
