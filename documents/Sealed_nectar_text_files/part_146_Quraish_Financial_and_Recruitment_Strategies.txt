"Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder (men) from the 
path of Allâh, and so will they continue to spend it; but in the end it will 
become an anguish for them. Then they will be overcomed." [Al-Qur'an 8:36] 
They also devised other ways of recruitment including hiring poets to entice the 
tribes into fighting the Muslims. Safwan bin Omaiyah allured Abu ‘Azza, the poet to 
work in this context in return for riches after the war or supporting his daughters if 
killed. Incidentally, this poet was prisoner of war (in the context of the Badr events) 
in the hands of the Muslims and the Prophet [pbuh] was gracious enough to release 
him unransomed provided he would not engage in fight against him. 
Abu Sufyan nursed the most grudge against Muslims because he had lost most of his 
supplies in As-Sawiq invasion, let alone the heavy economic losses that Quraish had 
sustained in the aftermath of the events that featured the platoon of Zaid bin 
Harithah. 
In the light of these successive failures, Quraish precipitated and accelerated their 
preparations for a decisive battle with the Muslims. At the turn of the year everything 
was ready for the move. The Makkans also decided to take their women along with 
them for they might arouse them to fight manfully. Thus a contingent of three 
thousand pitched warriors, of whom seven hundred were mailed soldiers and two 
hundred well-mounted[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/92; Fath Al-Bari 7/346] cavalry with three thousand 
camels and fifteen women marched towards Madinah. The general leader was Abu 
Sufyan bin Harb, the cavalry under the leadership of Khalid bin Al-Waleed assisted 
by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, and Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar were entrusted with the flag.
