It is also reported that a wretched idolater from Quraish, named ‘Uqbah bin ‘Abi 
Mu‘ait once trod on the Prophet’s neck while he was prostrating himself in prayer 
until his eyes protruded. [Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.113] 
More details reported by Ibn Ishaq testify to the tyrants’ deeply-established 
intentions of killing the Prophet [pbuh] . Abu Jahl, the archenemy of Islam, once 
addressed some of his accomplices: "O people of Quraish! It seems that Muhammad 
[pbuh] is determined to go on finding fault with our religion, degrading our 
forefathers, discrediting our way of life and abusing our gods. I bear witness to our 
god that I will carry a too heavy rock and drop it on Muhammad’s head while he is in 
prostration to rid you of him, once and for all. I am not afraid of whatever his sept, 
Banu ‘Abd Munaf, might do." The terrible unfortunate audience endorsed his plan 
and encouraged him to translate it into a decisive deed. 
In the morning of the following day, Abu Jahl lay waiting for the arrival of the 
Messenger of All?  [pbuh] to offer prayer. The people of Quraish were in their 
assembly rooms waiting for news. When the Prophet [pbuh] prostrated himself, Abu 
Jahl proceeded carrying the big rock to fulfill his wicked intention. No sooner had he 
approached closer to the Prophet [pbuh] than he withdraw pale-faced, shuddering 
with his hands strained the rock falling off. Thereupon, the people watching hurried 
forward asking him what the matter was. He replied: "When I approached, a male-
camel unusual in figure with fearful canines intercepted and almost devoured me." 
Ibn Ishaq reported that the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of his comment on the 
incident, said "It was Gabriel[AWS] , if Abu Jahl had approached closer, he would 
have killed him.[Ibn Hisham 1/298]" Even so the tyrants of Quraish would not be 
admonished, contrariwise, the idea of killing the Prophet [pbuh] was still being 
nourished in their iniquitous hearts. On the authority of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al-‘As, 
some people of Quraish were in a place called Al-Hijr complaining that they had been 
too patient with the Prophet [pbuh] , who suddenly appeared and began his usual 
circumambulation. They started to wink at him and utter sarcastic remarks but he 
remained silent for two times, then on the third, he stopped and addressed the 
infidels saying: 
"O people of Quraish! Hearken, I swear by All?  in Whose Hand is my soul, that you 
will one day be slaughtered to pieces." As soon as the Prophet [pbuh] uttered his 
word of slaughter, they all stood aghast and switched off to a new style of language 
smacking of fear and even horror trying to soothe his anger and comfort him saying: 
"You can leave Abul Qasim, for you have never been foolish." [Ibn Hisham 1/289] 
‘Urwa bin Az-Zubair narrated: I asked Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Al-‘As to tell me of the 
worst thing that the pagans did to the Prophet [pbuh] . He said: "While the Prophet 
[pbuh] was praying in Al-Hijr of Al-Ka‘bah, ‘Uqbah bin Al-Mu‘ait came and put his 
garment around the Prophet’s neck and throttled him violently. Abu Bakr came and 
caught him by his shoulder and pushed him away from the Prophet
