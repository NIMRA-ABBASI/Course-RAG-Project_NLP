Sa‘id Al-Khudri narrated that he heard the Prophet [pbuh] say, when the 
mention of his uncle was made, "I hope that my intercession may avail him, and he 
be placed in a shallow fire that rises up only to his heels." [Bukhari 1/548]  
Khadijah passes away to the Mercy of Allâh 
Only two months after the death of his uncle, did the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] 
experience another great personal loss viz., the Mother of believers, his wife 
Khadijah passed away in Ramadan of the tenth year of his Prophethood, when she 
was sixty-five years old, and he was fifty [Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl-al-Athar p.7; 
Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/164]. Khadijah was in fact a blessing of Allâh for the 
Prophet [pbuh] . She, for twenty-five years, shared with him the toils and trials of 
life, especially in the first ten years of his ministry of Prophethood. He deeply 
mourned over her death, and once he replied in an honest burst of tender emotions: 
"She believed in me when none else did. She embraced Islam when people 
disbelieved me. And she helped and comforted me in her person and wealth 
when there was none else to lend me a helping hand. I had children from 
her only."[Musnad Imam Ahmad 6/118] 
Abu Hurairah reported that Gabriel came to Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] and said: 
"Allâh’s Messenger, lo, Khadijah is coming to you with a vessel of seasoned food or 
drink. When she comes to you, offer her greetings from her Lord, and give her glad 
tidings of a palace of jewels in Paradise where there is no noise and no toil." [Bukhari 
1/539] 
These two painful events took place within a short lapse of time and added a lot to 
his grief and suffering. The Makkans now openly declared their campaign of torture 
and oppression. The Prophet [pbuh] lost all hope of bringing them back to the right 
path, so he set out for Al-Ta’if seeking a supportive atmosphere. But there too, he 
was disappointed and he sustained unbearable tortures and maltreatment that far 
outweighed his miserable situation in his native town. 
His Companions were on equal footing subjected to unspeakable torture and 
unbearable oppression to such an extent that his closest friend, Abu Bakr, to escape 
pressure, fled out of Makkah and wanted to leave for Abyssinia (Ethiopia) if it were 
not for Ibn Ad-Daghanah who met him at Bark Al-Ghamad and managed to dissuade 
him from completing his journey of escape and brought him back under his 
protection. [Bukhari 1/552; Ibn Hisham 1/372] 
The death of Abu Talib rendered the Prophet [pbuh] vulnerable, and the polytheists 
availed them of that opportunity to give free rein to their hatred and highhandedness 
and to translate them in terms of oppression and physical tortures. Once an insolent 
Quraishite intercepted him and sprinkled sand on his head. When he arrived home, a 
daughter of his washed the sand away and wept. "Do not weep, my daughter. Allâh 
will verily protect your father." The Prophet [pbuh] said. [Ibn Hisham 1/416]
