he Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implants the Spirit of Bravery among his Armed 
Forces 
The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] forbade the Muslims to start the fight without having 
an order from him. He, then, wore two armours — a front armour and a back one. 
He urged his Companions to fight and spurred them to show stamina and 
steadfastness at fight. He started to implant the spirit of boldness and bravery in 
them. To wage and inflame his Companions and in order to standfast in the fight, he 
took a sharp sword, held it in his hand and called out unto his Companions and said: 
"Who is ready to take this sword and give it its proper due?" Many a man set out to 
take it. Some of them were ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam and ‘Umar bin 
Al-Khattab. But it was granted to none. Abu Dujana Sammak bin Kharsha inquired: 
"O Messenger of Allâh, what is its price?" The Prophet [pbuh] said: "It is to strike the 
enemy’s faces with it till it was bent." So Abu Dujana said: "O Messenger of Allâh I 
will take it for that price." and he was given the sword. 
Abu Dujana was a man of courage who used to swagger at war. He had a red band 
which he wore round his head. Whenever he was head-banded everybody knew that 
he was determined to fight to death. Therefore as soon as Abu Dujana took the 
Prophet [pbuh]’s sword, he banded his head and started strutting amongst the 
fighters.
