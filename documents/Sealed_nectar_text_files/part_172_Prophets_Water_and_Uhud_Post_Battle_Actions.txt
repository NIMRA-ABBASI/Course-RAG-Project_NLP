e of those Muslim women who saw the defeated 
Muslim fighters entering Madinah, she started throwing dust at their faces rebukingly 
saying: "Here is a spinning wheel, take it! and give up carrying swords." Then she 
raced to the battlefield. There she watered the wounded. Hibban bin Al-‘Arqa shot an 
arrow at her, she fell down and her clothes were lifted up. Seeing that, the enemy of 
Allâh, burst into laughter. That sight upset the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], so he 
gave Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas an arrow lacking an arrow-head and said "Shoot it". Sa‘d 
shot it, it pierced the idolater’s throat. He fell down and some parts of his body were 
revealed. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then laughed so much that his molars could 
be seen. Sa‘d avenged her and Allâh responded to her supplication. [As-Seerat Al-Halabiyah 
2/22] 
As soon as the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reached the defile, ‘Ali bin Abu Talib went 
out and filled his water container with water from Al-Mihras. ‘Al-Mihras’ is said to be 
hollow (concaved) rock containing plenty of water. It was also said that it is a water 
spring in Uhud mountain. Anyway, ‘Ali brought that water to the Messenger of Allâh 
[pbuh] to drink. Finding that it smelt bad he refused to drink it, but only washed the 
blood off his face and poured some of it over his head saying: Allâh’s Wrath is great 
on those who besmeared His Messenger’s face with blood. [Ibn Hisham 2/85]
