hat all of them were killed in the 
battle of Badr. [Bukhari 1/37] 
Scandal-mongering and backbiting were also amongst the means of oppression that 
the chiefs of Makkah, in general, and Omaiyah bin Khalaf, in particular, resorted to in 
their overall process of evil-doing. In this regard, All?  says: 
"Woe to every slanderer and backbiter." [Al-Qur'an 104:1] 
‘Uqbah bin Al-Mu‘ait once attended an audience of the Prophet [pbuh] and listened to 
him preaching Islam. A close friend of his, Ubai bin Khalaf, heard of this. He could 
not tolerate any act of this sort, so he reproached ‘Uqbah and ordered him to spit in 
the Prophet’s holy face, and he shamelessly did it. Ubai did not spare any thinkable 
way to malign the Prophet [pbuh] ; he even ground old decomposed bones and blew 
the powder on him. Al-Akhnas bin Shuraique Ath-Thaqafi used to detract from the 
character of the Prophet [pbuh] in season and out of season. The Noble Qur’? , in 
direct reference to this man’s ignominious deeds, attached to him nine abominable 
traits: 
"And obey not everyone who swears much, — and is considered worthless, a 
slanderer, going about with calumnies, hinderer of the good, transgressor, sinful, 
cruel — after all that base-born (of illegitimate birth)." [Al-Qur'an 68:10-13] [Ibn 
Hisham 1/356] 
Abu Jahl’s arrogance and haughtiness blocked all avenues that could produce the 
least light of belief in his heart: 
"So he (the disbeliever) neither believed (in this Qur’? , in the Message of 
Muhammad [pbuh]) nor prayed!" [Al-Qur'an 75:31] 
He, moreover, wanted to debar the Prophet [pbuh] from the Noble Sanctuary. It 
happened once that the Prophet [pbuh] was praying within the precinct of the Sacred 
House, when Abu Jahl proceeded threateningly and uttering abusive language. The

Prophet [pbuh] chided him severely to which Abu Jahl answered back defiantly 
claiming that he was the mightiest in Makkah; All?  then revealed: 
"Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers)." [Al-Qur'an 96:17] 
In another version of the same incident, the Prophet [pbuh] took Abu Jahl by his 
neck, rocked him severely saying: 
"Woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you! Again, woe to you 
[O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!" [Al-Qur'an 75:34, 35]. 
Notwithstanding this reproach, Abu Jahl would never wake up to himself nor did he 
realize his foolish practices. On the contrary, he was determined to go to extremes, 
and swore he would dust the Messenger’s face and tread on his neck. No sooner had 
he proceeded to fulfill his wicked intention than he was seen turning back shielding 
himself with his hands (as if something horrible in his pursuit). His companions asked 
him what the matter was. He said: "I perceived a ditch of burning fire and some 
wings flying." Later on, the Messenger commented saying, "If he had proceeded 
further, the angels would have plucked off his
