Madinah. [Ibn Hisham 1/334-338] 
In this way Quraish’s malicious intentions recoiled on them and their machination 
met with utter failure. They came to fully realize that the grudge they nursed against 
he Muslims would not operate but within their realm of Makkah. They consequently 
began to entertain a horrible idea of silencing the advocate of the new Call once and

He then recited two lines of verse pregnant with meanings of full support to the 
Prophet [pbuh] and absolute gratification by the course that his nephew had chalked
