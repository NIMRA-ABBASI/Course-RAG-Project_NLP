Parading the Army 
As soon as he reached a location called Ash-Shaikhan, he paraded his army. He 
dismissed those whom he considered to be disabled or too young to stand the fight. 
Among them were ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. Usama bin Zaid; Usaid bin 
Zaheer, Zaid bin Thabit, Zaid bin Arqam. ‘Araba bin Aws, ‘Amr bin Hazm, Abu Sa‘eed 
Al-Khudri, Zaid bin Haritha Al-Ansari, Sa‘d bin Habba and Al-Barâ’ bin ‘Azib, Sahih Al-
Bukhari pointed out that he had shared in the fight that day. 
The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] allowed both Rafi‘ bin Khadaij and Samura bin Jundub 
to join the army — though they were too young. The former proved to be skillful at 
shooting arrows; the latter wrestled the former and beat him. The admission of Rafi‘ 
made Samura say: "I am stronger than him, I can overcome him." W
