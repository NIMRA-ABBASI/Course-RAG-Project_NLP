tion of Bani ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a: Among the group of 
delegates were ‘Amir bin At-Tufail — the enemy of Allâh, Arbad bin Qais — 
Labid’s maternal brother, Khalid bin Ja‘far, and Jabbar bin Aslam. All of them 
were the leaders and satans of their people. ‘Amir was the one who double-

of Bani so and so people. Fetch me my mare!" He mounted it but die
