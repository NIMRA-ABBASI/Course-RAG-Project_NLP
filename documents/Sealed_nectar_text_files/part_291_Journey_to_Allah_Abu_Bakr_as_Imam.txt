ahih Al-Bukhari 1/536]  
And said: 
"Allâh, the Great, has given a slave of His the opportunity to make a choice 
between whatever he desires of Allâh’s provisions in this world, and what 
He keeps for him in the world, but he has opted for the latter." 
Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudri said: "Upon hearing that, Abu Bakr cried and said: ‘We sacrifice 
our fathers and mothers for your sake.’ We wondered why Abu Bakr said such a 
thing. People said: ‘Look at that old man! The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] says about 
a slave of Allâh who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world 
and the bounty of Allâh in the Hereafter, but he says: We sacrifice our fathers and 
mothers for your sake!’ It was later on that we realized what he had aimed at. The 
Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was the slave informed to choose. We also acknowledged 
that Abu Bakr was the most learned among us." [Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/546] 
Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: 
"The fellow I feel most secure in his company is Abu Bakr. If I were to make 
friendship with any other one than Allâh, I would have Abu Bakr a bosom 
friend of mine. For him I feel affection and brotherhood of Islam. No gate 
shall be kept open in the Mosque except that of Abu Bakr’s." [Sahih Al-
Bukhari 1/22, 429, 449, 2/638; Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/548] 
  Four days before his death 
On Thursday, four days before the death of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], he said to 
people — though he was suffering from a severe pain: "Come here. I will cause you 
to write something so that you will never fall into error." Upon this ‘Umar bin Al-
Khattab said: "The Prophet of Allâh [pbuh] is suffering from acute pain and you have 
the Qur’ân with you; the Book of Allâh is sufficient unto you." Others however 
wanted the writing to be made. When Muhammad [pbuh] heard them debating over 
it, he ordered them to go away and leave him alone. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/637] 
That day he recommended three things: 
1. Jews, Christians and polytheists should be expelled out of Arabia.  
2. He recommended that delegations should be honoured and entertained, in a 
way similar to the one he used to do.  
3. As for the third — the narrator said that he had forgotten it. It could have 
been adherence to the Holy Book and the Sunnah. It was likely to be the 
accomplishment and the mobilization of Osamah’s army, or it could have been 
performance of prayers and being attentive to slaves.

In spite of the strain of disease and suffering from pain, the Prophet [pbuh] used to 
lead all the prayers till that Thursday — four days before he died. On that day he led 
the sunset prayer and recited: 
"By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allâh) sent forth one after 
another." [Al-Qur'an 77:1] [Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/102] 
In the evening he grew so sick that he could not overcome the strain of disease or 
go out to enter the Mosque. ‘Aishah said: The Prophet [pbuh] asked: "Have the 
people performed the prayer?" "No. They haven’t. They are waiting for you." "Put 
some water in the washing pot." Said he. We did what he ordered. So he washed 
and wanted to stand up, but he fainted. When he came round he asked again "Have 
the people prayed?" Then the same sequence of events took place again and again 
for the second and the third times from the time he washed to the time he fainted 
after his attempts to stand up. Therefore he sent to Abu Bakr to
