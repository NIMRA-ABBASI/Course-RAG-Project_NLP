accept his Call. [At-Tirmidhi; Masud Ahmad, 3/492,4/341] 
  Attempts made to check the Onward March of Islam 
Having fully perceived that Muhammad [pbuh] could never be desisted from his Call, 
Quraish, in a desperate attempt to quell the tidal wave of the Call, resorted to other 
cheap means acting from base motives: 

56
1. Scoffing, degrading, ridiculing, belying and laughter-instigating cheap 
manners, all of which levelled at the new converts in general, and the person 
of Muhammad [pbuh] in particular, with the aim of dragging the spirit of 
despair into their morale, and slackening their ardent zealotry. They used to 
denounce the Prophet [pbuh] as a man possessed by a jinn, or an insane 
person:  
"And they say: O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur’? ) 
has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man." [Al-Qur'an 15:6] 
or a liar practising witchcraft, 
"And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) 
has come to them from among themselves! And the disbelievers say: "This 
(Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is a sorcerer, a liar." [Al-Qur'an 38:4]. 
Their eyes would also look at the good man as if they would ‘eat him up’, or 
trip him up, or disturb him from the position of stability or firmness. They 
used all sorts of terms of abuse ‘madman’ or ‘one possessed by an evil spirit’, 
and so on: 
"And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes 
through hatreds when they hear the Reminder (the Qur’? ), and they say: 
Verily, he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is a madman!" [Al-Qur'an 68:51] 
Amongst the early converts, there was a group who had unfortunately no 
strong clan at their back to support them. These innocent souls were ridiculed 
and jeered in season and out of season. Referring to such people, the 
highbrow Quraish aristocrats used repeatedly to ask the Prophet [pbuh], with 
jest and scorn: 
"All?  has favoured from amongst us?" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] 
And All?  said: 
"Does not All?  know best those who are grateful?" [Al-Qur'an 6:53] 
The wicked used to laugh at the righteous in many ways: 
a. They would inwardly laugh at their Faith, because they felt themselves 
so superior.  
b. In public places, when the righteous passed, they used to insult and 
wink at them,  
c. In their own houses, they would run them down.  
d. Whenever and wherever they saw them, they reproached and called 
them fools who had lost their way. In the Hereafter, all these tricks 
and falsehoods will be shown for what they are, and the tables will be 
reversed. All?  had said:  

57
"Verily! (During the worldly life) those who committed crimes used to laugh at 
those who believed; and whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to 
another (in mockery); and when they returned to their own people, they 
would return jesting; and when they saw them, they said: ‘Verily! These have 
indeed gone astry!’ But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as 
watchers over them (the believers)." [Al-Qur'an 83:29-33] 
2. Distorting Muhammad’s teachings, evoking ambiguities, circulating false 
propaganda; forging groundless allegations concerning his doctrines, person 
and character, and going to excess in such a manner in order to screen off 
any scope of sound contemplation from the public. With respect to the Qur’? , 
they used to allege that it was:  
"Tales of the ancients, which he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has written down, and 
they are dictated to him morning and afternoon." [Al-Qur'an 25:5] 
The iniquitous went on ceaselessly inculcating in people’s ears that the Qur’?
 
was not a true Revelation: 
"This (the Qur’? ) is nothing but a lie that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) has 
invented, and others have helped him at it." [Al-Qur'an 25:4] 
The wicked would also attribute to men of All?  just such motives and springs 
of action as they themselves would be guilty of in such circumstances. The 
pagans and those who were hostile to the revelation of All?  and Islam, could 
not understand how such wonderful verses could flow from the tongue of the 
Prophet [pbuh] without having someone to teach, and claimed: 
"It is only a human being who teaches him." [Al-Qur'an 16:103] 
They also raised another baseless and superficial objection: 
"Why does this Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) eat food and walk about in 
the markets (like ourselves)?" [Al-Qur'an 25:7] 
They were sadly ignorant and painfully at fault for they could not perceive 
that a teacher for mankind is one who shares their nature, mingles in their 
life, is acquainted with their doings, and sympathises with their joys and 
sorrows. 
The Noble Qur’?  has vehemently refuted their charges and allegations and 
has explained that the utterances of the Prophet [pbuh] are the Revelations 
of the Lord and their nature and contents provide a bold challenge to those 
who attribute his Prophetic expressions to some base origin, at times to the 
mental throes of a dreaming reformer, at others to the
