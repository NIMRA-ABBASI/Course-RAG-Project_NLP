Sudâ’ Delegation: The arrival of this delegation was after the departure of 
the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] from Al-Ji‘ranah in the eighth year of Al-Hijra. 
It was because the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had already dispatched a 

287
mission that comprised four hundred Muslims and asked them to go to where 
Sudâ’ was. Sudâ’ was (a fresh-water fountain) in Yemen. While the mission 
was camping there at the starting point of a canal. Ziyad bin Al-Harith As-
Sudâ’i learned of their stay, so he came to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and 
said: "I have come to you as a deputy of my people, so tell your army to go 
back and I guarantee of my people." The army were sent away off the canal. 
In his turn As-Sudâ’i went back, cherished and urged his people to come and 
meet the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].
