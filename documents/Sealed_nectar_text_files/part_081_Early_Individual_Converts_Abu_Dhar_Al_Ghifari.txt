3. Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari. He used to live in the suburbs of Yathrib. News of the 
Islamization of Swaid bin Samit and Eyas bin Mu‘adh reached him and 
constituted a turning point in his life per se. He sent his brother to Makkah for 
more details about the Prophet’s intentions. The man came back and reported 
to Abu Dhar that the ‘said man’ enjoined good and forbade evil. Abu Dhar was 
not satisfied and decided that he himself should go out and probe the real 
situation. After some attempts to identify the person of the Prophet [pbuh], 
he managed to meet him though not without some difficulties due to the 
antagonistic atmosphere within which the proponents of the new faith were 
trying to work their way. No sooner than Abu Dhar was exposed to the real 
nature of Islam, he embraced it. Despite the Prophet’s earnest plea not to 
divulge his new move, Abu Dhar went directly to the Holy Sanctuary where he 
publicly declared that he had testified to the Oneness of Allâh and 
Prophethood of Muhammad. The heathens all around hurried and began 
beating him. He almost died when Al-‘Abbas intervened warning against 
killing someone whose tribe was in full command of the strategic commercial 
caravan routes leading to Makkah
