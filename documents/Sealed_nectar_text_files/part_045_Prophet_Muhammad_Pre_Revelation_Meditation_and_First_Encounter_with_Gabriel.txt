In the Shade of the Message and Prophethood
When Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] was nearly forty, he had been wont to pass long 
hours in retirement meditating and speculating over all aspects of creation around 
him. This meditative temperament helped to widen the mental gap between him and 
his compatriots. He used to provide himself with Sawiq (barley porridge) and water 
and then directly head for the hills and ravines in the neighbourhood of Makkah. One 
of these in particular was his favourite resort — a cave named Hira’, in the Mount 
An-Nour. It was only two miles from Makkah, a small cave 4 yards long and 1.75 
yard wide. He would always go there and invite wayfarers to share him his modest 
provision. He used to devote most of his time, and Ramadan in particular, to worship 
and meditation on the universe around him. His heart was restless about the moral 
evils and idolatry that were rampant among his people; he was as yet helpless 
because no definite course, or specific approach had been available for him to follow 
and rectify the ill practices around him. This solitude attended with this sort of 
contemplative approach must be understood in its Divine perspective. It was a 
preliminary stage to the period of grave responsibilities that he was to shoulder very 
soon. [Rahmat Al-lil'alameen 1/47; Ibn Hisham 1/235,236; Fi Zilal Al-Qur'an 29/166]
