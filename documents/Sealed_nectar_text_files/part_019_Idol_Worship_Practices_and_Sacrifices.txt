Polytheism and worship of idols became the most prominent feature of the religion of 
pre-Islam Arabs despite alleged profession of Abraham’s religion. 
Traditions and ceremonies of the worship of their idols had been mostly created by 
‘Amr bin Luhai, and were deemed as good innovations rather than deviations from 
Abraham’s religion. Some features of their worship of idols were:  
1. Self-devotion to the idols, seeking refuge with them, acclamation of their 
names, calling for their help in hardship, and supplication to them for 
fulfillment of wishes, hopefully that the idols (i.e., heathen gods) would 
mediate with All?  for the fulfillment of people’s wishes. 
2. Performing pilgrimage to the idols, circumrotation round them, self-
abasement and even prostrating themselves before them. 
3. Seeking favour of idols through various kinds of sacrifices and immolations, 
which is mentioned in the Qur’? ic verses:  
"And that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone-
altars)" [Al-Qur'an 5:3]
