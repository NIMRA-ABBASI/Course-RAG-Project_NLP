olitical picture within Madinah. Five hundred kilometres away in 
Makkah, there still lay another source of detrimental threat, the archenemy of Islam, 
Quraish. For ten years, while at the mercy of Quraish, the Muslims were subjected to 
all sorts of terrorism, boycott, harassment and starvation coupled by a large scale

temporal and religious leadership in Madinah. He accorded to everyone his due 
portion whether of mercy or punishment, with the former usually seasoning the
