defend you, but I can’t quit the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib." 
Abu Lahab then said to Abu Talib: " I swear by All?  that this is a bad thing. You 
must stop him before the others do." Abu Talib, however, answered: "I swear by 
All?  to protect him as long as I am alive." [Fiqh As-Seerah p.77,78]  
On Mount As-Safa 
After the Messenger of All?  [pbuh] became sure of Abu Talib’s commitment to his 
protection while he called the people unto All? , he stood up on Mount As-Safa one 
day and called out loudly: "O Sabahah! [This is an Arabic expression used when one 
appeals for help or draws the attention of others to some dangers] " Septs of 
Quraish came to him. He called them to testify to the Oneness of All?  and believe in 
his Messengership and the Day of Resurrection. Al-Bukhari reported part of this story 
on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas [R]. He said: "When the following verses were 
revealed: 
"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred." [Al-Qur'an 26:214] 
The Messenger of All?  [pbuh] ascended Mount As-Safa and started to call: "O Bani 
Fahr! O Bani ‘Adi (two septs of Quraish)." Many people gathered and those who 
couldn’t, sent somebody to report to them. Abu Lahab was also present. The Prophet 
[pbuh] said: "You see, if I were to tell you that there were some horsemen in the 
valley planning to raid you, will you believe me?" They said: "Yes, we have never 
experienced any lie from you." He said: "I am a warner to you before a severe 
torment." Abu Lahab promptly replied: "Perish you all the day! Have you summoned 
us for such a thing?" The verses were immediately revealed on that occasion 
[Bukhari 2/702; Muslim 1/114]: 
"Perish the two hands of Abi Lahab..." [Al-Qur'an 111:1]. 
Muslim reported another part of this story on the authority of Abu Hurairah [R] — He 
said: "When the following verses were revealed: 
"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred." [26:214] 
The Messenger of All?  [pbuh] called all the people of Quraish; so they gathered and 
he gave them a general warning. Then he made a particular reference to certain 
tribes, and said: "O Quraish, rescue yourselves from the Fire; O people of Bani Ka‘b, 
rescue yourselves from Fire; O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad [pbuh] , rescue 
yourself from the Fire, for I have no power to protect you from All?  in anything 
except that I would sustain relationship with you." [Muslim 1/114; Bukhari 
1/385,2/702] 
It was verily a loud suggestive Call stating unequivocally to the closest people that 
belief in his Message constituted the corner-stone of any future relation between him 
and them, and t
