RCD stands for Regional Cooperation for Development. It was an organization established in 1964 by:

Iran

Pakistan

Turkey

The goal was to promote socio-economic development and cooperation among the three member countries. It focused on trade, transport, industry, culture, and technical education.

RCD was later dissolved in 1979, primarily due to political changes (such as the Iranian Revolution).

It was replaced in 1985 by ECO (Economic Cooperation Organization), which included more countries and expanded objectives.
