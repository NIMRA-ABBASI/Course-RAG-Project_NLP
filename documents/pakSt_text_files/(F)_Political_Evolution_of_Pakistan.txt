Pakistan’s politics have changed many times: 

 Army Involvement 

Army took over the government many times. 

4 main military dictators: Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia-ul-Haq, Musharraf.  	Each time, democracy was stopped. 

🗳️ Weak Democracy 

Even when democracy returned, political parties were not strong. 

Leaders cared more about their own power than public service. 

Parties were based on personalities, like: 

o 	Nawaz Sharif (PML-N) o 	Imran Khan (PTI) o 	Zardari (PPP) 

⚖️ Unfair Laws 

The President had the power to dismiss elected governments (like with Article 58-2(b)). 

⚠️ Problems Today 

Political fighting, no long-term planning, and corruption are big issues. 

People lose trust in politicians because of these repeated failures. 

💡 Fact: Between 1988 and 1999, no Prime Minister completed a 5-year term. 

👉 Simple meaning: Pakistan’s politics have been like a rollercoaster – sometimes ruled by the army, sometimes by weak civilian leaders. True democracy has not been stable.
