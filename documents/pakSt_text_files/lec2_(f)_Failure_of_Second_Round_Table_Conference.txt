Failure of Second Round Table Conference

The Second Round table conference was failed due to the Communal representation.

The Communal Award which is also known as the MacDonald Award was created by the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald on 16 August 1932. The first and second round table conferences were failed and it was seemed that it is impossible to resolve the communal problems so in 1932 the British Government announced its own formula known as Communal Award. This award retained separate electorate for Muslims and all other minorities.

So, it was announced after the Round Table Conference (1930-32) and extended the separate electorate to depressed classes and other minorities.

Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah decided to accept this award till alternative solution. The Hindu press considered it against the fundamental principle of nationalism for India.
