Nehru Report-1928-Review

The Nehru Report of 28 August 1928 was a memorandum to appeal for a new dominion status and a federal set-up of government for the constitution of India. It also proposed for the Joint Electorates with reservation of seats for minorities in the legislatures.



Key Points of Nehru Report-Review

The main points of the Nehru report were as follows:
India would be given Dominion status. This means independence within the British Commonwealth.
India will be a federation which shall have a bicameral legislature at the centre and Ministry would be responsible to the legislature.

Governor General of India would be the constitutional head of India and will have the same powers as that of British Crown.
There will be no separate electorate.
The draft report also defined the citizenship and fundamental rights.

The novel features of the Nehru Committee Report were almost accepted by the Indian leaders. The next session of the Congress was held in Calcutta in December 1928. In this session, the Nehru Report was accepted by a majority vote.
With few exceptions League leaders rejected the Nehru proposals. In reaction Mohammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in 1929 which became the core demands the Muslim community put forward as the price of their participating in an independent united India.

The congress gave an ultimatum to the British Government to accept the recommendation of the report by December 31, 1929 and also threatened for another mass movement in case the report is not accepted. The report was not accepted by the Government.
