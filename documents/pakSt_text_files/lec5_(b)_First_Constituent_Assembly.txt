First Constituent Assembly

In order to establish a society based on the Islamic principles, a constituent assembly was formed in 1947 with Quaid-e-Azam as its leader.

The responsibility of making a constitution of Pakistan rested on Constituent Assembly.

However, with the death of Quaid-e-Azam on 11th September 1948, the responsibility of framing the constitution fell onto the shoulders of the first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan
