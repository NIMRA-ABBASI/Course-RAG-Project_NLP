Pakistan was made to be a country where: 

Islam would be followed 

People would be treated fairly 

There would be democracy (rule by the people) 

Everyone would have equal rights 

But in real life, this hasnâ€™t fully happened. 

Islam is followed, but some laws and actions are more political than religious. 

Democracy has been weak. Military (army) has taken over the government many times. There have been dictators like General Zia and Musharraf who ruled for years without elections. 

Rights of people, especially minorities (non-Muslims), are protected in the law, but in practice, they sometimes face problems like discrimination or unfair treatment. 

Corruption, unemployment, and inflation are big problems today. Pakistan is facing economic crises, debt issues, and political instability (fights between political parties). 

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: Pakistan ranks low on the Democracy Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit (score: around 4.3/10 in recent years) â€“ which means itâ€™s not a full democracy yet.
