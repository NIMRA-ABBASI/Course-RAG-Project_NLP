Pakistan was needed because: 

ğŸ“Œ Cultural and Religious Differences 

Muslims and Hindus had very different lifestyles, food, prayers, festivals, etc. ï‚· 	Muslims were not comfortable under Hindu-majority rule. 

ğŸ“Œ Discrimination 

Under British rule and later Congress Party rule, Muslims felt left out. 

Their jobs, education, and political voice were weaker compared to Hindus. 

ğŸ“Œ Protection of Rights 

Muslims wanted a country where they could live freely, follow Islam, and develop without fear. 

ğŸ’¡ Example: In the 1946 elections, the Muslim League won most of the Muslim seats, showing that Muslims wanted a separate homeland. 

ğŸ‘‰ Simple meaning: Muslims felt unsafe and ignored in India. They needed a place where they could live with freedom and dignity.
