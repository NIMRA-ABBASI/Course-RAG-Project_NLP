Partition of Bengal

The decision was announced on July 19, 1905 by Viceroy of India Lord Curzon.
The partition took place on October 16, 1905.

The partition of Bengal was the most important event during the rule of Lord Curzon.
It was carried out mainly for the convenience of administration. Bengal in those days was the biggest province of India extending over 1,89,000 square miles with a population of almost 78 million.

It was comprising of Bengal, Behar and Orissa and was under the central of one lieutenant Governor.
After Lord Curzon took charge as Governor General of India the discussion over the Partition began.

The first Partition of Bengal (1905) was a territorial reorganization of the Bengal Presidency implemented by the authorities of the British Raj. The reorganization separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas.

The partition was supported by the Muslims of East Bengal and their support was motivated by both their poor economic conditions in East Bengal, as well as the believed dominance of the Hindu businessmen in West Bengal over the governance of Bengal.
