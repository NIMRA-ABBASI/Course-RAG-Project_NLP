Religious Diversity in Pakistan
Pakistan is also a religiously diverse country, with Islam being the dominant religion. Approximately 95% of Pakistan's population is Muslim, and the majority of Muslims in Pakistan follow the Sunni branch of Islam. However, Pakistan is also home to significant populations of Hindus, Christians, and Sikhs. Each of these religions has its unique cultural practices and traditions that contribute to the country's cultural diversity.
The religious diversity in Pakistan has been a source of both unity and conflict. On one hand, the country's religious diversity has contributed to a rich and diverse cultural heritage. Religious festivals and celebrations, such as Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha, Christmas, Diwali, and Holi, are celebrated with great enthusiasm and serve as a reminder of the country's cultural richness. However, religious diversity can also lead to conflict, as different religious groups may have competing interests and beliefs. This has led to sectarian violence in Pakistan, particularly between Sunni and Shia Muslims.
