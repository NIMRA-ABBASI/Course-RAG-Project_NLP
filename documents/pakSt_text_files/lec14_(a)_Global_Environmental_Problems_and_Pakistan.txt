Global Environmental Problems and Pakistan

Pakistan's as a developing country attempted to raise the living standards of its citizens and economic development has largely taken priority over environmental issues.

Unchecked use of hazardous chemicals, vehicle emissions, and industrial activity has contributed to a number of environmental and health hazards. One of the main is among them being water pollution. Much of the country suffers from a lack of potable water due to industrial waste and agricultural run off that contaminates drinking water supplies.

Pakistan's high priority actions to reduce these emissions (climate change alleviation) include a commitment, first made in a statement by Prime Minister Imran Khan at the UN Climate Summit in December 2020, that by 2030, 60% of all energy produced in Pakistan will be generated from renewable resources.

Pakistan, on June 5, hosted World Environment Day 2021 in partnership with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

World Environment Day takes place every year on 5 June and held annually since 1974, the Day has also become a vital platform for promoting progress on the environmental dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals. World Environment Day is the United Nations’ principal vehicle for encouraging worldwide awareness and action for the environment.

The observance of World Environment Day have the theme of ‘Ecosystem Restoration’ and focus on resetting our relation with nature. It also marked the formal launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030. The UN Decade is intended to massively scale up the restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems to fight the climate crisis, prevent the loss of a million species and enhance food security water supply and livelihoods.
