GANDHI-IRWIN PACT

On January 25, 1931, in Delhi, all other members of the Congress Working Committee and Gandhi were released unconditionally and Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed.

Gandhi, on behalf of Congress, agreed to suspend the civil disobedience movement and attend the next roundtable.

It can be said that Lord Irwin decided that in the absence of Congress leaders the future of India could not be decided.
