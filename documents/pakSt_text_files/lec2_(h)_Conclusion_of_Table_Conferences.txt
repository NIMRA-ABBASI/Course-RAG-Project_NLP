Conclusion

To sum up, we can say that the first Conference did not gain success because of the absence of the Congress, the Hindu representative and the second Conference remained fail because of the presence of the Congress which even enhanced the level of hostility between the Hindu and the Muslims and the communal award proved even final blow to the relations of the two communities of Indian subcontinent.

As result of these conferences British Government issued a White Paper based on the recommendations which was handed over to Select Committee. On July 4, 1935 a new constitution of India came into being which was approved by both of the Houses of the Parliament.

The Round Table Conferences were carried out in contemporary to the Civil Disobedience Movement. After the First Round Table, the British government, for the first time was on back foot, Irwin accepted almost every demand of Gandhi.

The second round table conference was held under the new Viceroy, he broke the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Again in the third round table conference met without the leaders of Congress. B.R. Ambedkar attended all three conferences and was the contended person because of the communal Award. The Award, which provides reserved seats for minorities, can also be seen in present politics. Many delegates were not in favor of Gandhi's demand for Joint Electorates.

Lack of mutual agreement among the Indian delegates leads to the inconclusive result of the Round Table Conference.
