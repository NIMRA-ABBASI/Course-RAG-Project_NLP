Imports & Exports in Pakistan

The major exports of Pakistan include textiles, leather and sports goods, chemicals, carpets, and rugs. Meanwhile, Pakistan also exports significant quantities of rice, sugar, cotton, fish, fruits, and vegetables.

Imports include petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizer, capital goods (goods that are used in producing other goods, rather than being bought by consumers), industrial raw materials, and consumer products.

Capital Goods

Capital goods are physical assets that a company uses in the production process to manufacture products and services that consumers will later use. Capital goods include buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and tools. Capital goods are not finished goods, instead, they are used to make finished goods.

Balance of Trade

Trade consists of two basic components: exports and imports.

Balance of Trade formula = Country's Exports – Country's Imports.
Positive trade balance signifies a trade surplus, while a negative value signifies a trade deficit.

Pakistan's payments problems have been chronic since the 1970s, with the cost of oil imports primarily responsible for the trade imbalance.

Increased imports and softer demand for Pakistan's textiles and apparel in major markets also caused the current account deficit to further increase.
