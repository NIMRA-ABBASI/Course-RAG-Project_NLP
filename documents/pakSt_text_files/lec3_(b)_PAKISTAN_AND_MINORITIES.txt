PAKISTAN AND MINORITIES

Pakistan is the first country in the world to reassure its minorities about their future rights by specifically allocating a portion of the national flag i.e. the white color in the flag of Pakistan.

You are free; you are free to go to your temples,
you are free to go to your mosques or to any other
place or worship in this State of Pakistan.
You may belong to any religion or caste or creed -
that has nothing to do with the business of the State.
