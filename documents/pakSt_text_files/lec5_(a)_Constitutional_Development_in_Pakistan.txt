Constitutional Development in Pakistan

Constitution

The basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or social group that determine the powers and duties of the government and guarantee certain rights to the people in it.

The system of beliefs and laws by which a country, state, or organization is governed.

Background

By the end of World War II, the British imperial government granted independence to its Indian colony and for that matter the British Parliament enacted the Indian Independence Act, 1947.

Under the Act, the British Crown relinquished its sovereign powers over India and transferred those powers to the newly established India and Pakistan.

The Government of India Act, 1935 (the constitution of British India) was amended to bring it in consonance with the aims and objectives of independence as laid down in the 1947 Act.

The combination of these two constitutional instruments served as an interim constitutional order for both countries until their respective constituent assemblies adopt their own constitutions.

To sum up, Pakistan was created out of ideological and political struggle but at the very beginning of its establishment, it had no Islamic constitution of its own, so according to the independence act of 1947, the government of India Act 1935, with certain amendments was adopted by Pakistan.

However, a new constitution was to be framed for the country since the act of 1935 did not contain everything required for an independent Islamic state.
