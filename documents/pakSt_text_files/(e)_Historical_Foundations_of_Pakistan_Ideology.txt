📌 Two-Nation Theory 

Muslims and Hindus were two different nations. 

Their religion, culture, and traditions were too different to live under one country.  	So Muslims needed their own country: Pakistan. 

📌 Islamic Identity 

Pakistan was made to be a safe place for Muslims, to follow their religion and live with dignity. 

It doesn’t mean non-Muslims are not welcome. Jinnah clearly said minorities would have full rights. 

📌 Justice and Equality 

Islam teaches justice and fairness. 

Pakistan’s ideology includes equal rights for all, regardless of religion. 

💡 Fact: The name “Pakistan” was first used in 1933 by Chaudhry Rahmat Ali. It means “Land of the Pure.” 

👉 Simple meaning: Pakistan was made so Muslims could live with freedom, follow their religion, and be treated fairly. The country’s foundation was both Islamic and democratic.
