Abrogation of Article 370

On August 05, 2019, India re-annexed Kashmir by scrapping so-called special status under Article 370 and 35A of Indian constitution. These 2 articles of Indian constitution granted Jammu and Kashmir region under India a certain amount of autonomy including its own constitution, a separate flag, and authority to make laws. The people of Jammu and Kashmir could make their own laws relating to permanent residency, ownership of property, and fundamental rights. These laws also barred non-Kashmiri Indians from outside the province from purchasing property or settling there. Although since 1953, India had slowly and steadily weakened the nature of autonomy granted under these two articles.



Impact

The implementation of the abrogation of Article 370 is a threat to the democracy. It is an attempt to polarize and appease the Hindu population in the valley.

After the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region was bifurcated into two centrally-administered Union Territories (UTs) specifically UT of Jammu and Kashmir and UT of Ladakh. India shares borders with China in Ladakh. And the step is being seen as Indiaâ€™s move to settle border disputed with Beijing.

After bifurcation (the division of something into two branches or parts.), the disputed region came directly under the so-called federal (central) government of India.

Conclude

The two nuclear-armed South Asian nations have fought three wars since they became free nations in 1947, and remain deeply distrustful of each other. Tension has sharpened since August 2019 when India ended the autonomy of its only Muslim-majority region, Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan
