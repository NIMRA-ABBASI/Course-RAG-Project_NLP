Steps Taken By Pakistan

After facing long-drawn-out violence for more than a decade, Pakistan has achieved progressive and significant improvement in the country’s overall security landscape in recent years.

This has been achieved primarily due to comprehensive counter terrorism operation culminating with Zarb-e-Azb and Khyber-I-IV operations and counter-terrorism measure taken by the Government under the framework of the National Action Plan (NAP), and the sacrifices of the security forces. This has resulted in a major decline in the number of terrorist attacks as well as the causalities suffered.
