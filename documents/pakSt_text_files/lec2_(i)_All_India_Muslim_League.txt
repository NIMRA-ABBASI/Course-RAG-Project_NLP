All India Muslim League

The All India Muslim League was established in 1906. The league as per its stated aims struggled for the constitutional safeguard of Muslim rights and interests.

One of the achievements of the league was the provision of separate electorates for Muslims in Minto-Morley Reforms 1909. Other immediate achievements included one-third representation at the center, quota in civil service and government jobs, etc. in a united India.

Indian National Congress opposed the establishment of the league as a British tactic of its divide and rule policy. It opposed the efforts and achievements of the league without any second thought. For example, it opposed separate electorates provided in the Indian Councils Act 1909 for Muslims.
