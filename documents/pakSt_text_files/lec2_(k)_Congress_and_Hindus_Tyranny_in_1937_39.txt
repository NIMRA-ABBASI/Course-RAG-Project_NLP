Congress and Hindus Tyranny in 1937-39

Congress made its government in provinces, it left no stone unturned to torture Muslims socially, religiously, economically, and politically. Muslim homes and properties were set on fire, noisy processions were held outside mosques. Any complaint made to authorities fell on deaf ears.

These atrocities of Hindus and the Congress convinced Muslims that any formula of United India would not suit Muslim interests. Now they wanted a separate homeland where they could live their lives as per their own will and religious teachings. This was the background of the league's demand for a separate state for Muslims of the Indian subcontinent on 23rd March 1940.
