Political Structure:
Pakistan has a federal parliamentary system of government, with a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. The country is divided into four provinces, each with its own assembly and Chief Minister, and two federally administered territories. This political structure was established after Pakistan gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947.

While this system of government provides for representation and decision-making at various levels, it has also been criticized for its failure to accommodate cultural diversity. In particular, the country's system of provincial and territorial division has been a source of tension between the different regions of Pakistan. For example, the province of Balochistan has long felt marginalized and neglected by the federal government, leading to ongoing political unrest and insurgency in the region.
Similarly, the province of Sindh has a distinct cultural identity and history, and there have been calls for greater provincial autonomy and recognition of Sindhi cultural rights. However, the dominant Urdu-speaking elite in Pakistan has historically marginalized and suppressed Sindhi culture, leading to social and political tensions between the two groups.
