Pakistan and Regional Peace

Pakistan is one of the largest Muslim-majority country and is the only Muslim majority nation to have possession of nuclear weapons. Pakistan has trade ties with the EU and economic alliances and agreements with many Asian nations.

Pakistan is member of Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for past more than three decades.

SCO, with both security and economic cooperation in its scope, presents even brighter prospects for Pakistan for a broader regional level engagement.
