Significant Failure (SAARC)

SAARC has failed in achieving its objectives because India-Pakistan rivalry has become a bottleneck (Blockage) in achieving effective coordination. Last SAARC summit got cancelled because of the Indo-Pak tensions. Even though the region accounts more than 21% of world population, globally its share is not prominent.

The organizationâ€™s activities have also been remained sluggish and frustratingly slow in the last 30 years of its existence. Since its establishment, lots of government level meeting of SAARC have been held and plenty of agreements have been signed but produced hardly any remarkable outcome.

SAARC has not yet achieved any notable success in any of its areas. Nearly 35% of the population in South Asia currently earns an income of less than one dollar. The formation of SAARC in 1985 has added almost nothing to eliminate the problem of poverty in this region.

It has not been able to increase trade between the member states despite the promulgation of SAFTA or the South Asian Free Trade Agreement. Despite its existence since the 1980s, SAARC has been unable to achieve its objects.
