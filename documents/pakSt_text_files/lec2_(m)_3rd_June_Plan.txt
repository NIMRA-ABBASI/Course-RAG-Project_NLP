3rd June Plan

When on 3rd June 1947, the British announced its plan to partition India, the local political parties the Congress, and the league welcomed it.

This paved way for Indian independence and the establishment of two separate independent states in the Indian subcontinent.

To put the third June Plan into effect, the British parliament passed the Indian Independence Act on 15 July 1947.

The Act stated that on 15 August 1947 British the Indian sub-continent would be partitioned into two dominion states India and Pakistan. Each State would have complete freedom to pass any law.

The Government of India Act would be the provisional constitution until the states devised their own. On 14 August a new country, Pakistan, came into being. On 15 August India was declared independent.

The third June plan, 1947 was an official and formal acceptance of the Partition of the Indian subcontinent into two independent states of Pakistan and India. The British and Congress had been opposing the partition but now they had come to this realization that the only solution of the Indian subcontinent was the partition of India.

The third June plan paved way for the passage of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 which finally led to the establishment of one of the Muslim nations on the map of the world. Today, the announcement has a wide acceptance as a success of the vision and struggle of Mr. Jinnah and the league.

Throughout the struggle, Quaid-e-Azam remained steadfast in his demand for Pakistan in the face of the last Indian viceroy Lord Mount Batten and Congress scramble to prevent the partition.
