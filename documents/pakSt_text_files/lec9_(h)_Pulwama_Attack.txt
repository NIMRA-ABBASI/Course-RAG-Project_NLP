After Pulwama

The year 2019 has been a turning point moment in the history of Kashmir. It started with the Pulwama attack of February 14, where a suicide car bomber killed 40 and left many wounded. Indian claimed that Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack not only brought the neighbors (India and Pakistan) to the brink of war, but made life a little more difficult for the people of Kashmir.
