SAARC can play a vital role in stabilizing and strengthening South Asia by:

Promoting regional peace and security through dialogue and cooperation among member nations.

Encouraging economic integration to foster trade, investment, and development across borders.

Coordinating joint efforts on issues like climate change, health crises (e.g., pandemics), poverty, and education.

Reducing regional tensions by facilitating diplomacy and cultural exchange programs.

Enhancing people-to-people connectivity via travel, education, and technology partnerships.

Serving as a collective voice for South Asia in global forums.

However, its effectiveness depends on the political will of the member states to set aside bilateral conflicts and work together.
