Simon Commission-1927

In 1927 British Government appointed a commission to draft constitution. The commission was called the Simon Commission that was headed by Sir John Simon.

Under the Act of 1919, after every 10 years new reforms were to be introduced in India by the Indian British Government and for this purpose a commission was formed. Therefore, British government set up this commission to look into the government of India act of 1919.

So, the aim of the commission was to investigate the working of the act and to suggest further reforms in the system of administration.

This commission was failed in its objective. After this Nehru report was formed in 1928 but this report was rejected by Muslim leaders and Muhammad Ali Jinnah presented 14 points against this report but these points were not accepted by Hindus. Under these conditions the constitutional crisis took a serious shape and to overcome the crisis 3 round table conferences were held in London from 1930 to 1932.
