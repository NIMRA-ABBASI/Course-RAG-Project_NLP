Hindrances (Agriculture)

Following are the causes of our backwardness in agriculture:

The farmers of our country are mostly uneducated and lack technical knowledge. They are unable to understand the modern scientific methods of agriculture and often remain ignorant of good means to protect and increase their yield. Their production is therefore low.

The majority of our farmers are poor and they often live in a hand to mouth position. Most of them are always under heavy burdens of debt. Hence, they cannot attain the required standards.

Most of our farmers are still stuck to the old traditions of their forefathers. The circumstances have compelled them to use the crude implements because due to small holdings of land and poverty they are unable to acquire and use modern scientific methods. That is why their standard is lower than that of cultivators in developed countries.

Our farmers have to face many problems due to scarcity of water which is one of our major problems. Rainfall is uncertain and the existing irrigational facilities in our country are quite insufficient and need to be extended.

Due to the lack of agricultural education and methods of modern research, our farmers cannot control the various diseases of crops and attacks of pests and insects. The result is low yield.

The agricultural activities in our country are performed in rural areas, but most of our villages have no road or railway links with our markets.

Therefore, farmers have to face innumerable hardships to sell their products. Hence the farmers take very little interest in their profession and production suffers.

Agricultural Policies

Land Reforms are introduced from time to time by different governments. The aim was to strengthen the position of tenants. It was done for poverty alleviation in agriculture field.
