Critically examine the key shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy after 9/11. Focus on Pakistan's relations with the US and India.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks marked a watershed moment for Pakistan's foreign policy, leading to significant and complex shifts, particularly in its relations with the United States and India.

Relations with the US: Immediately after 9/11, Pakistan became a crucial strategic ally for the United States in its "War on Terror." This decision, as confessed by then-President Pervez Musharraf, was made under considerable pressure, as the US had threatened Pakistan if it did not cooperate. This alliance led to the lifting of US sanctions previously imposed on Pakistan and Pakistan being designated a major non-NATO ally. Pakistan played a key role in facilitating the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, permitting the transit of material across its territory. However, this relationship was fraught with challenges. The US often pressured Pakistan to "do more" to control Taliban militants and eliminate safe havens.

A significant point of tension arose when the US launched a unilateral operation deep inside Pakistan. This operation resulted in the killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011, further complicating bilateral ties. 

The Pak-US relationship during this period is described as "complex, troublesome, and transactional," based on instrumental exchange rather than ideological affinity, and has been termed "clientelistic." Despite common goals, priorities often differed, and Pakistan remained concerned about its territorial integrity.

Relations with India: While Pakistan was deeply engaged with the US on its western border, its relationship with India remained tense, with the Kashmir dispute as the primary source of conflict. The post-9/11 global focus on counter-terrorism brought new dimensions to Indo-Pak relations. India often blamed Pakistan for initiating insurgency in Kashmir, equating it with terrorism. Although there were periods of attempted dialogue, the underlying distrust and conflict persisted. Events like the 2019 Pulwama attack, which India attributed to Pakistan-based militants, brought the two nuclear-armed neighbors to the brink of war. Furthermore, India's abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, which scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further sharpened tensions. The "War on Terror" dynamic sometimes saw increased international scrutiny on cross-border militancy, impacting Pakistan's leverage on the Kashmir issue.

In essence, post-9/11, Pakistan's foreign policy was characterized by a difficult balancing act: cooperating with the US in Afghanistan while managing the domestic fallout and navigating an increasingly complex relationship with India, all under the shadow of regional instability and the global fight against terrorism.
