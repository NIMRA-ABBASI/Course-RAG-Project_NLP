Round Table Conferences

Round Table Conferences started in November 1930 and ended in December 1932.

The three Round Table Conferences of 1930-32 were a series of conferences organized by the British Government and Indian political personalities to discuss constitutional reforms and formulate future constitution of India in the light of suggestions given by the Indian Leaders.

On 19 June, 1930 British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald summoned the Indian Leader to attend these conferences.

On 13 March, 1930 Gandhi decided to celebrate Independence Day and started Civil Disobedience Movement for complete independence of India. However, Muslim leaders stayed away from the movement because Hindus were exploiting the Muslim demand for their own rights.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah had already given a proposal to British Prime Minister to settle down this issue in London. Gandhi had given ultimatum for the approval of Nehru Report. In this scenario, when the first Round Table Conference started M.K Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were in the jail.

Muhammad Ali Jauhar in April 1930 declared, "The aim of the movement was not to work for Indian independence but to make Muslims slave of Hindu Mahasabaha".

First Round Table Conference (Nov 1930 â€“ Jan 1931)

The first round table conference took place in London between November 1930 and January 1931. It was inaugurated by King George five on November 12, 1930, and chaired by Ramsay McDonald.

This was the first conference organized between the British and the Indians on an equal footing.

The Congress refused to attend the conference, but the Indian princely states, the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Sikhs, the Parsi, the liberals, the depressed classes, the Anglo Indians, and the Europeans attended the conference.

Not much was achieved at the meeting; the British government realized that it was necessary for Indian National Congress to be part of any discussion regarding the future of constitutional government in India.
