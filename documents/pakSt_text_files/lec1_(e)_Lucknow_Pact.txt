Lucknow Pact-1916

The Lucknow Pact was an agreement reached between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League (AIML) at a joint session of both the parties held at Lucknow in December 1916.

Through the pact, the two parties agreed to allow representation to religious minorities in the provincial legislatures.

The major achievement of Lucknow pact was that the moderates and radicals reunited and they jointly demanded self rule for India. All the Indians became united and protested against Britishers for self-rule.
