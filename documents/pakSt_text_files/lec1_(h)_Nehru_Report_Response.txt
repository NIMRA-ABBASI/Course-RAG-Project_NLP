Nehru Report Response

The report was not acceptable to Muslims and both the Muslim members of the Committee did not sign it. Syed Ali Imam, due to bad health could not attend the meetings of the Committee while Shoaib Qureshi refused to sign the report. In the fourth session of the All Parties Conference convened in December to review the Nehru Report, Jinnah representing the Muslim League presented following four amendments in the report:
There should be no less than one-third Muslim representation in the Central Legislature.
In event of the adult suffrage not being established, Punjab and Bengal should have seats reserved for the Muslims on population basis.
The form of the constitution should be Federal with residuary powers vested in the provinces.
Sind should immediately be made a separate province and the reforms should also be introduced in NWFP and Balochistan at the earliest.

Jinnah's proposals were rejected when put to vote in All Parties Conference. The Congress managed to get the majority vote in favour of the Report. They asked the Government to make a constitution till December 31 according to the recommendations of Nehru Report and threatened that otherwise the party would start a mass movement for the attainment of Swaraj. It was also decided that January 26 would be celebrated as the Independence Day. Jinnah considered it as the "parting of the ways" and once the "Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity" was now convinced that the Hindu mindset in India was bent upon pushing the Muslim minority to the wall.
