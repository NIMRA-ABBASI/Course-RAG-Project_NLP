Climate Change - Global Warming

Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter.

These heat-trapping pollutants specifically carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is called the greenhouse effect.



Climate Change - Air pollution

Air pollution is a major problem confronting Pakistan, with cities like Lahore and Karachi ranking among the most polluted worldwide.



Climate Change - Deforestation

There is growing recognition within the international community that deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries play a significant role as ‘cause and effect’ of climate change.

When trees are growing, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but when they are destroyed they release all the carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere, causing global warming. Deforestation is responsible for about 20% of global warming.



Species extinction

Various studies indicate that climate change is affecting, directly or indirectly, the flora and fauna as well as their habitats leading to their displacement and in most severe cases, even extinction. Climate change is also affecting the competitiveness of different species by differently altering their growth, mortality rates and regeneration success rates. This may adversely affect synchronous functioning of life cycles of plants, animals and soil organisms.

Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the international union for conservation of nature has rated the bird's status as "endangered".



Ozone layer depletion

Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, which is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders. UV rays also affect plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity.
