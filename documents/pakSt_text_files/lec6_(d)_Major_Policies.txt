Civilian government adopted policies for the welfare and betterment of the people but their effects were compromised due to several reasons: 

Problem of keeping coalitions intact; 

Weak political parties, which weakened the government; 

Greater confrontation; 

Complaints of corruption and misuse of state resources. 

1999-2002: 

In 1999 again Military Rule was imposed against the civilian government’s attempt to concentrate power in the office of Prime Minister. Nawaz government introduced political and constitutional changes to have a complete control on all branches of the government. 

Nawaz government’s attempt to remove the Army Chief, while he was out of the country and returning from his visit to Sri Lanka, proved counter productive. General Musharraf took over as the Chief Executive of the country and suspended the constitution. Martial law was not declared. No military courts were established. Political and press freedoms remained intact.

Rebuild national confidence and morale;
