Objectives Resolution of Pakistan 1949

Objectives Resolution

Objectives Resolution is one of the most significant and illuminating document in the constitutional history of Pakistan.

It laid down the objectives on which the future constitution of the country was to be based.

It proved to be the foundational stone in the constitutional development in Pakistan.

Its importance can be ascertained from the fact that it served as a preamble for the constitution of 1956, 1962, and 1973.

About the future constitution of Pakistan, the founder of the nation, Quaid-e-Azam in February 1948 stated that:

“The constitution of Pakistan will be democratic and based on the fundamental laws of Islam… Islam and its ideology has taught us the lesson of democracy.”

The Objectives Resolution is also called a great manifesto (Magna Carta), which paved the way for making of the Constitution of Pakistan.

Objective Resolution was presented in the Constituent Assembly by Liaquat Ali Khan on March 7, 1949 and was debated for five days.

This resolution was passed by the first Constituent Assembly on 12th March 1949 under the leadership of Liaquat Ali Khan.

After passing the Objective Resolution, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan set up a “Basic Principle Committee” to spell out proposals for the Constitution in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Objective Resolution.
