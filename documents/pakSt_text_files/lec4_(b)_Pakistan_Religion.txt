Pakistan Religion

Pakistan was formed as an Islamic nation, and Islam continues to be the religion of approximately 97 percent of the population.
The Muslim majority areas were mostly carved out into Pakistan after the partition of subcontinent. Therefore, the large majority of the population of Pakistan is comprised of Muslims. Members of several minority religions also live there, including Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs etc

The negligible minority of Hindus is settled mainly in the border districts of Sindh. Christians are widely spread throughout the country. The Parsis (Zoroastrians). are an economically notable minority, mostly settled in Karachi.
The constitution of Pakistan also guarantees the right of minorities to profess, practice and propagate their religion.
