Radcliff Award

Announcement of the Boundary Commission Awards on August 17, 1947, came as a big shock for the All India Muslim League, especially its leader, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Jinnah, who trusted the British judicial system, was not expecting a biased decision from Radcliffe.

He, like many, thought that the Muslims' interests were forfeited in the Award, as a number of areas in both the Punjab and Bengal with Muslim majority population were given to India.

Furthermore, the allocation of a part of district of Gurdaspur to India provided a corridor through which it got access to Kashmir.

The decision to partition the Punjab and Bengal was taken and the next step was to establish the proper mechanism.

Initially it was proposed that the task of demarcating the boundaries of the Punjab and Bengal should be given to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice.

Jinnah supported the suggestion but Nehru opposed the notion.
