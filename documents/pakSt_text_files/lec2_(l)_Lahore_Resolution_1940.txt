Lahore Resolution 1940

The All India Muslim League Resolution of March 1940, commonly known as the Pakistan Resolution, is undoubtedly the most important event that changed the course of Indian history and left deep marks on world history. With the passage of this Resolution, the Muslims of the sub-continent changed their demand from "Separate Electorates" to a "Separate State."

This Resolution rejected the idea of a United India and the creation of an independent Muslim state was set as their ultimate goal.

It gave new energy and courage to the Muslims of the region who gathered around Quaid-i-Azam from the platform of the Muslim League to struggle for their freedom.

The dynamic leadership of the Quaid e Azam and the commitment and devotion of the followers made it possible for them to achieve an independent state within seven years of their struggle.
