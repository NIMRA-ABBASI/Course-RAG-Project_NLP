Pakistan's economy is characterized by three main sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture has traditionally been a major sector, serving as the primary occupation for a significant portion of the population, providing food, raw materials for industries, and foreign exchange. It contributes substantially to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs a large part of the labor force. Key agricultural outputs include wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables.

The industrial sector is considered crucial for economic development and prosperity. Major industries include textiles (a significant export earner), sugar, cement, iron and steel, paper, defense production, fertilizers, and vehicle manufacturing. The services sector, which includes tourism, also plays a significant role in the economy.

Natural resources are vital for Pakistan's economic stability. The country possesses considerable mineral resources such as iron ore, chromite, gypsum, coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium, which are essential for industrial activity and energy generation. Rivers like the Indus and its associated canal systems are the backbone of agriculture through irrigation and also provide hydroelectric power. Forests provide timber, fuel, and support biodiversity, while animal husbandry contributes milk, meat, wool, and serves as a source of foreign exchange. Effective management and utilization of these resources are key to the nation's development.

Trade significantly impacts Pakistan's economic stability. Major exports include textiles, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals, carpets, rice, sugar, and cotton. However, Pakistan also relies heavily on imports such as petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizers, capital goods, and industrial raw materials. The country has faced chronic balance of payments problems, particularly due to the high cost of oil imports, which contributes to trade imbalances and current account deficits. Thus, managing the balance of trade is critical for economic stability.
