Drawbacks Of Virtualization: VMs Take Up a Lot of System Resources 
One of the most significant practical drawbacks of virtualization, particularly when deploying 
multiple virtual machines (VMs), is their substantial consumption of system resources. 
• Full OS and Virtual Hardware: Each VM is not merely a lightweight application; it runs 
a full copy of an operating system (OS). This includes the OS kernel, system services, 
drivers, and all associated processes. Furthermore, each VM also includes a virtual copy 
of all the hardware that its guest OS needs to run. This virtual hardware (virtual CPU, 
virtual RAM, virtual network cards, virtual disk controllers) must be emulated or managed 
by the hypervisor, consuming host resources. 
• Cumulative Resource Demand: When you host multiple VMs on a single physical server, 
the resource demands are cumulative. Each VM requires its own allocation of: 
o RAM (Random Access Memory): The host server must have enough physical RAM 
to satisfy the memory requirements of all running VMs plus the host OS and 
hypervisor itself.  
o CPU Cycles: While CPUs can be shared, each VM's processing needs contribute to 
the overall load on the host's physical CPUs. High CPU demand from multiple VMs 
can lead to performance degradation if the host CPU capacity is insufficient. 
o Disk Space: Each VM requires disk space for its OS, applications, and data. 
o Network Bandwidth: Each VM will consume network bandwidth for its 
communications. 
How Many VMs Per Host? How Much is Too Much? 
The question of how many VMs can be run on a single host server doesn't have a one-size-fits-all 
answer. While it might be technically possible to run a very large number of VMs (e.g., "500 VMs on 
one server host is possible"), the optimal number is often less and depends on several critical 
factors: 
• Risk: Concentrating too many critical VMs on a single physical host increases the risk. If 
that host fails, all the VMs running on it will go down, potentially causing a significant 
outage. 
• Utilization Rates: The actual resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O) of 
each VM is crucial 
• Memory Factor: Memory is often a primary limiting factor. The total RAM required by all 
VMs cannot exceed the physical RAM available on the host (minus what the host OS and 

hypervisor need) without resorting to slower swapping mechanisms, which severely 
degrades performance. 
• Purpose of Virtualization: The text emphasizes that "Virtualization doesn't just 
consolidate as many servers as possible - it has to actually do something." This means 
the VMs must perform their intended functions adequately. Overloading a host will lead to 
poor performance for all hosted VMs.
