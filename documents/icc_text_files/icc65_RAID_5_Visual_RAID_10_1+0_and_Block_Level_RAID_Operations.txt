RAID 5 (Striping with Distributed Parity) - Visual Explanation: 
A diagram illustrates RAID level 5: 
• Four disk icons ("DISK 1" to "DISK 4") are shown, each with four horizontal segments. 
• Data blocks (A, B, C, etc.) and Parity blocks (Parity) are distributed across these disks. 
o Example Stripe 1: A (Disk 1), B (Disk 2), C (Disk 3), Parity (Disk 4) 
o Example Stripe 2: D (Disk 1), E (Disk 2), Parity (Disk 3), F (Disk 4) 
o (And so on, with the parity block rotating to a different disk for each stripe). 
This visual demonstrates how data is striped across disks, and crucially, how the 
parity information for each stripe is also distributed across all the disks in the array. 
This distributed parity allows the array to reconstruct data if any single disk fails. 
RAID 10 (RAID 1+0 or Mirrored Stripes): Details 
RAID 10, also known as RAID 1+0, is a nested RAID level that combines the features of RAID 1 
(mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping) to provide both high performance and high fault tolerance. 
• Data Distribution: It works by first creating mirrored sets of disks (RAID 1 pairs) and then 
striping data (RAID 0) across these mirrored sets. So, data is first mirrored for redundancy, 
and then these mirrored pairs are striped together for performance. 
• Performance: Offers excellent read and write performance. Striping across multiple 
mirrored pairs allows for high throughput, while mirroring ensures data is readily available 
from redundant copies. It generally provides better write performance than RAID 5 because 
it doesn't have the overhead of parity calculations. 
• Fault Tolerance: RAID 10 can tolerate the failure of one disk in each mirrored 
pair without data loss. If more than one disk fails within the same mirrored pair, the array 
will fail. However, it can tolerate multiple disk failures as long as no single mirrored pair 
loses all its disks. It offers strong redundancy combined with high performance. 
• Minimum Disks: Requires a minimum of four disks (two mirrored pairs, with each pair 
then striped). 
• Storage Efficiency: Similar to RAID 1, the usable capacity is 50% of the total raw capacity 
of all disks (e.g., four 1TB disks in RAID 10 provide 2TB of usable storage). 
How Block-Level RAID Works (General Read Operation): 
The text briefly explains how block-level RAID (like RAID 0, 5, 10) operates during data access: 

• Data is divided into blocks and distributed across multiple disks. 
• During a read operation, the RAID system (managed by a RAID controller, either hardware 
or software) accesses these blocks from the multiple disks in parallel. 
• This parallel access speeds up the overall data retrieval process.
