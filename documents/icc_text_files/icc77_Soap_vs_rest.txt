 
SOAP vs REST 
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) 
 A protocol introduced in 1999. 
 Focuses on exchanging structured XML messages between systems. 
 Platform-agnostic and language-independent. 
 Suited for enterprise-level systems needing strict standards, security, and reliability. 
 However, it's considered heavyweight due to its complexity and reliance on XML. 
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) 
 Proposed by Roy Fielding in 2000. 
 An architectural style, not a protocol. 
 Uses simple HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 
 Sends and receives data in JSON or XML formats. 
 More lightweight and scalable than SOAP. 
 Widely used in mobile apps and modern web services due to its simplicity and flexibility. 
In REST, every interaction targets a resource, and the HTTP method used defines the action on that 
resource. RESTful APIs became the standard for efficient, device-agnostic communication. 
REST API in Action 
A RESTful API uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations: 
 POST → Create a new resource 
 GET → Read or retrieve data 
 PUT/PATCH → Update an existing resource 
 DELETE → Remove a resource 
Endpoints follow a consistent structure: 
 Correct: 
o POST /api/users 
o GET /api/users 
o PATCH /api/users/:id 
o DELETE /api/users/:id 

 Incorrect (non-RESTful): 
o POST /api/createUsers 
o GET /api/readUsers 
o PUT /api/updateUser 
o DELETE /api/deleteUsers 
In REST: 
 The endpoint refers to the resource (like /users). 
 The HTTP verb defines the action. 
 You should avoid including verbs in the URI path. 
REST APIs allow a client (e.g., a mobile app) to request the state of an object from a server and get back 
its representation—usually in JSON or XML. This is what the term Representational State Transfer 
means. 
What is SOAP? 
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured data via XML. It supports 
strict security, transaction management, and is ideal for enterprise-level applications requiring 
reliability. 
SOAP in Action Example: 
Imagine a banking service using SOAP to transfer funds: 
Key Features of SOAP: 
 Uses only XML. 
 Has a fixed messaging structure (Envelope, Header, Body). 
 Supports WS-Security for secure message exchange. 
 Platform-agnostic but more complex than REST
