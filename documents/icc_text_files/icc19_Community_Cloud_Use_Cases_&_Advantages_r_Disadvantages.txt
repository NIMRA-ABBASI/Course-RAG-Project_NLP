Use Cases for Community Cloud: 
The community cloud model is particularly beneficial for groups of organizations that need to 
collaborate, share resources, or meet common regulatory or security standards. Specific use 
cases include: 
• Healthcare Consortium: Multiple hospitals, clinics, and research institutions can share a 
community cloud to collaborate on medical research, share anonymized patient data for 
studies, or run common healthcare applications. This setup helps them meet strict patient 
data security and privacy regulations (like HIPAA) while benefiting from shared 
infrastructure costs. 
• Educational Institutions: Several universities or school districts might use a community 
cloud to host shared online learning platforms (LMS), research databases, digital libraries, 
or administrative systems. This allows for cost-sharing and easier collaboration on 
educational resources and research projects. 
• Law Firms: A group of law firms, perhaps specializing in a particular area or located in the 
same jurisdiction, could share a community cloud for document management, case 
management systems, and legal research tools. This would help them maintain strict legal 
privacy standards and manage client confidentiality while sharing costs for specialized 
legal tech infrastructure. 
• Non-Profits: Multiple Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working on similar causes 
or in related sectors can use a community cloud to manage shared resources, collaborate 
on joint projects or campaigns, share donor databases (with appropriate permissions), and 
save on infrastructure costs, allowing more funds to be directed towards their core 
missions. 
Advantages of the Community Cloud Model: 
The community cloud offers several distinct benefits for its members: 
• Cost-Effective: It is generally more cost-effective than each organization building and 
maintaining its own private cloud because the infrastructure costs are shared by multiple 
organizations or communities. 
• Security: Community clouds can provide better security than a public cloud for specific 
community needs because security policies and controls can be tailored to the collective 
requirements of the member organizations, which are often more stringent than general 
public cloud offerings. 

• Shared Resources: It allows member organizations to share resources, infrastructure, 
applications, and services (e.g., specialized software relevant to their industry), leading to 
better utilization and access to a wider range of tools. 
• Collaboration and Data Sharing: The model is inherently suitable for both collaboration 
and data sharing among member organizations that have common goals or projects, 
facilitating joint efforts. 
Disadvantages of the Community Cloud Model: 
Despite its benefits, the community cloud model also has certain limitations: 
• Rigid in Customization (Potentially): Because the data and resources are shared among 
different organizations according to their mutual interests and agreed-upon governance, if 
a single organization wants to make significant changes tailored only to its specific 
needs, they might not be able to do so easily.
