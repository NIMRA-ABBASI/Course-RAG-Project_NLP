Multitenant Technology (Part 2) and Multitenancy vs Virtualization 
Multitenant Technology (cont’d) 
Multitenant application architecture is often significantly more complex than that of single-tenant 
applications. These applications need to support sharing of various artifacts (portals, data schemas, 
middleware, databases) among multiple users, while maintaining security levels that segregate 
individual tenant environments. 
Key Features: 
 Usage Isolation: One tenant's activity doesn’t affect others. 
 Data Security: Each tenant’s data is private and secure. 
 Recovery: Data is backed up and restored individually. 
 Application Upgrades: Updates applied without impacting tenant operations. 
 Scalability: System scales to handle more users or tenants. 
 Metered Usage: Tenants are billed based on actual use. 
 Data Tier Isolation: Each tenant may have separate databases or tables. 
Example: In a multitenant email service, different companies use the same software platform 
but their email data, user settings, and custom features remain separate and secure. 
Diagram Description (Figure 5.11): 
Shows two organizations (“Organization A” and “Organization B”) each with a cloud service consumer 
connecting to a central multitenant application running on a hosting virtual server. This illustrates a 
single application instance serving multiple tenants while maintaining separation. 
Multitenancy vs. Virtualization 
(Image Description: The left side features interconnected translucent green and blue cubes with glowing 
edges, representing virtualized environments.) 
Multitenancy is sometimes confused with virtualization, but they differ in what is multiplied within a 
physical server: 
 Virtualization: Multiple virtual copies of server environments can be hosted on a single physical 
server. Each can have its own OS and applications and be independently configured. 
 Multitenancy: A physical or virtual server hosts an application designed for multiple users, each 
feeling exclusive usage.
