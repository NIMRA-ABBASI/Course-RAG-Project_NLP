What is Cloud Computing? 
Cloud computing, defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is: 
"A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable 
computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." 
10 Emerging Technologies in the Cloud Computing Zone 
Cloud computing is closely linked with several emerging technologies that are shaping its future. These 
include: 
1. Containers: Lightweight units that package software and its dependencies. 
2. Serverless Computing: Running applications without managing servers. 
3. Microservices: Breaking down applications into small, independent services. 
4. DevOps: Combining software development and IT operations for faster delivery. 
5. Internet of Things (IoT): Connecting physical devices to the internet. 
6. Artificial Intelligence (AI): Using machines to perform tasks that typically require human 
intelligence. 
7. Edge Computing: Processing data near the source to reduce latency. 
8. Kubernetes: An open-source system for managing containerized applications. 
9. DevSecOps: Integrating security into the DevOps process. 
10. Open Source: Collaborative development that drives innovation. 
These technologies contribute to cloud computing’s flexibility, scalability, and capability, making cloud 
solutions more powerful and efficient. 
 
Understanding Cloud Computing Through an Example 
Consider you need powerful computational resources for a complex problem. Traditionally, you had 
three options: 
 Option 1: Buy yourself. 
Order a server from manufacturers like HP, IBM, or Dell. Install it in your own data center or 
rented colocation space (e.g., Switch, Equinix). You are responsible for maintenance and 
upkeep. 
 Option 2: Lease a server. 
Lease equipment from a leasing company, which delivers the hardware to you. You still install 
and configure it in your data center or colocation facility. 

 Option 3: Rent a server. 
Rent from managed service providers like Savvis, Rackspace, or Terremark. They allocate and 
deploy servers for you in their data centers. You operate the server, but infrastructure 
management is theirs.
