Handling Temporary Failures (Sloppy Quorum & Hinted Handoff) 
Problem: Handling temporary failures 
Techniques Used: Sloppy Quorum and Hinted Handoff 
Traditional Quorum: 
In distributed systems, a quorum is the number of nodes required to agree on a data update. 
For example, in a 5-node system, a quorum might require 3 nodes to accept a write. 
Sloppy Quorum: 
 Relaxes the requirement of writing to specific nodes. 
 If one node in the quorum is unavailable, another available node is temporarily used. 
 This ensures availability and allows operations to continue during failures. 
How It Works: 
 If node C is down, write goes to node D instead. 
 Later, node D syncs the data back to node C once it recovers. 
Hinted Handoff: 
 The alternate node (like D) stores the data with a "hint" that it belongs to node C. 
 When node C comes back, the hinted data is forwarded to it and removed from D. 
Benefits: 
1. High Availability: Writes continue despite failures. 
2. Fault Tolerance: Temporary nodes keep the system running. 
3. Flexibility: Reduces downtime and delays for users. 
Challenges: 
 Eventual Consistency: Data might not be consistent immediately. 
 Increased Latency: Synchronization introduces delay. 
 Complexity: Handling handoffs and reconciliation can be intricate. 
Example: 
 System with 5 nodes: A, B, C, D, E 
 Quorum: Write (W) = 3, Read (R) = 3 
 Node B is down, write happens on Node D. 
 Once B is back, data is synced from D to B. 
Formula to Ensure Consistency: 

 R + W > N (e.g., 3 + 3 > 5 = 6 > 5) ensures overlap and consistency.
