Drawbacks Of Virtualization: Performance Issues 
While virtualization offers numerous benefits, it's important to acknowledge potential drawbacks, 
a primary one being performance issues. 
• Overhead Introduction: Virtualization software (the hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor) 
inherently introduces a certain amount of overhead to the computer system on which it 
operates. This overhead stems from the additional layer of software that sits between the 
virtual machines (VMs) and the physical hardware.  
• Impact Assessment: Determining the precise overall impact that virtualization software 
imposes on system performance can be a difficult and complex task. The extent of the 
overhead can vary significantly based on the type of hypervisor used (Type 1 vs. Type 2), the 
specific workloads running on the VMs, the configuration of the host system, and the 
efficiency of the hardware's virtualization support. 
• Areas of Impact: 
o Processor and Memory: Generally speaking, modern virtualization solutions, 
especially those leveraging hardware assistance, have a minimal impact on raw 
processor and memory performance for most workloads. VMs can often execute 
CPU-bound tasks and access memory with near-native speed. 
o Disk and Networking: However, a more significant performance impact is often 
observed in disk I/O and networking performance. Accessing storage and network 
resources from within a VM usually involves the hypervisor mediating these 
requests, which can introduce latency and reduce throughput compared to direct 
hardware access. Optimizing storage and network configurationsis crucial to 
mitigate these impacts. 
Drawbacks Of Virtualization: Common Hardware 
Another consideration when implementing virtualization revolves around the common 
hardware shared by all virtual machines running on a single physical host. This shared nature 
presents both benefits (like server consolidation) and potential drawbacks. 
• Shared Resource Dependency: Since the only physical hardware on which the VMs run 
is the same for all VMs on that host, all virtual machines are dependent on the capabilities 
and limitations of that single set of physical components (CPU, RAM, storage controllers, 
network interface cards). 

• Compatibility and Requirements: A significant drawback arises if the operating system 
(OS) or application you intend to virtualize has specific hardware requirements that are not 
met by the host system, or if it's incompatible with the host's hardware architecture. 
o Example: If an application requires a specialized piece of hardware (e.g., a specific 
graphics card for CAD software, a particular industrial I/O card) that cannot be 
effectively virtualized or passed through to the VM, or if the host server simply 
doesn't possess it, then virtualizing that application on that host becomes 
problematic or impossible. 
• "Out of Luck" Scenario: The text succinctly states: "If the OS and application that you 
want to virtualize are not capable of running on the system hardware or require other 
hardware, you’re out of luck with virtualization. "
