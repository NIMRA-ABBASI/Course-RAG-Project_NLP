The limitations of earlier inter-system communication methods, particularly their struggles with interoperability, 
scalability, and ease of use, became glaringly apparent as the internet expanded. The shift away from servers 
rendering full HTML pages towards sending raw, structured data marked a significant evolution. Instead of relying 
on HTML parsing, clients began receiving data in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML 
(eXtensible Markup Language). JSON, with its key-value pair structure and human-readable syntax, became a 
lightweight and efficient choice, especially popular in web applications due to its native compatibility with 
JavaScript. XML, a hierarchical data structure using tags to define elements, offered robust capabilities for complex 
data models and document validation. Both formats allowed for a clean separation between data and presentation, 
empowering different client applications (web browsers, mobile apps, other backend services) to consume the same 
data and render it according to their specific needs. 
However, as highlighted by the "Issue" section, merely using structured data formats didn't inherently solve all 
problems. The core challenge persisted: the lack of a consistent and standardized architectural style for 
interacting with this data. Without a guiding paradigm, API implementations remained ad-hoc and chaotic. 
Developers would often invent their own conventions for endpoint naming 
(e.g., /api/getUserData vs. /api/deleteUser), the types of HTTP requests to use (e.g., using POST for 
data retrieval), and how to manage data for different operations. This proliferation of non-standard methods led to 
significant complexities: clients needed to learn a unique "API language" for every service they integrated with, 
increasing development time and bug potential. Maintaining and scaling such systems became a monumental task, 
as consistency was absent, and new developers faced steep learning curves. It was evident that while JSON and 
XML were excellent data interchange formats, they didn't provide the architectural blueprints for building robust, 
scalable, and easily maintainable APIs. 
This pressing need for standardization and better architectural practices paved the way for the emergence of two 
dominant web service architectural styles: SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (REpresentational 
State Transfer). SOAP, introduced in 1999, specifically addressed the requirement for standardized messaging 
through XML. It provided a highly formal and extensible framework for exchanging structured information in a 
decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP messages are verbose, envelope-based XML documents, allowing 
for complex message structures and error handling. While often perceived as more complex and heavyweight than 
REST, SOAP excels in enterprise environments with stringent security, reliability, and transaction requirements. Its 
extensive set of "WS-*" specifications (e.g., WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging) makes it a preferred choice for 
scenarios demanding strong contracts, ACID transactions, and guaranteed message delivery, such as in banking, 
healthcare, or government applications, where tools like Web Services Description Language (WSDL) are used to 
define the formal contract of the service. Meanwhile, REST, formalized by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral 
dissertation, presented a lightweight, flexible, and highly scalable alternative, perfectly suited for the evolving 
needs of the web and mobile applications, which prioritized simplicity and broad interoperability.
