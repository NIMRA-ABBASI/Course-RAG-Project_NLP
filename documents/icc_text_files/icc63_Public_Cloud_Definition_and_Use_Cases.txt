Public Cloud: Definition and Characteristics 
The Public Cloud model makes IT systems and services accessible to virtually anybody over the 
internet. It is defined as a type of cloud computing in which a third-party service provider owns, 
manages, and operates the cloud infrastructure (servers, storage, networking, etc.) and offers 
these resources to the general public or major industry groups. A key characteristic is that 
the infrastructure is owned by the entity delivering the cloud services, not by the consumer. 
This model allows customers and users to easily access systems and services on a pay-as-you-go 
or subscription basis, often without significant upfront investment. For example, services like 
storage, backup, and retrieval might be offered for free up to a certain limit, on a subscription 
basis, or based on per-user fees. Google App Engine is cited as an example of a public cloud 
service (specifically a Platform as a Service, or PaaS). 
An illustrative diagram often depicts the Public Cloud model with a central "Cloud Service 
Provider" icon (a cloud shape with server icons inside). Various diverse entities. 
Use Cases for Public Cloud: 
The public cloud model is well-suited for a wide variety of applications and scenarios due to its 
cost-effectiveness, scalability, and ease of use. Common use cases include: 
• Blogging Platform: A blogger might host their website on a public cloud provider like 
Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is often affordable, requires no direct infrastructure 
management by the blogger, and can easily handle fluctuations in website traffic. 
• Mobile App Startup: A small startup developing a mobile application can use a public 
cloud like Google Cloud to quickly launch and scale their app. This allows them to start 
with minimal upfront costs for hardware and infrastructure, and then scale resources as 
their user base grows. 
• E-commerce Site: An online shop can run its platform on Microsoft Azure. This enables 
the business to handle significant traffic spikes, especially during holiday sales or 
promotional events, without needing to own, manage, and maintain the physical servers 
required for peak load. They can scale resources up during busy times and down during 
quieter periods. 
• Gaming Company: A game developer can host multiplayer game servers on a public 
cloud. This ensures high availability for gamers across different regions, low latency, and 
the ability to scale server capacity based on the number of active players, all without the 
company having to manage the underlying hardware infrastructure. 

These examples highlight the public cloud's strengths in providing on-demand resources, 
reducing the burden of infrastructure management, and offering a flexible, cost-efficient platform 
for various applications.
