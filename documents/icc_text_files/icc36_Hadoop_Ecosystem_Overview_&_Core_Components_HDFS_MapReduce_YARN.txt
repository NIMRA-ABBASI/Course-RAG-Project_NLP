Hadoop EcoSystem:  
Core Components (Mandatory/Crucial): 
These are fundamental to Hadoop's operation: 
1. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): 
o Representation: Often shown with a green elephant logo and "hadoop HDFS" text. 
Labeled as "Hadoop Distributed File System. " 
o Purpose: HDFS is the primary storage system of Hadoop. Its main purpose is 
to manage and store very large datasets in a distributed manner across clusters 
of commodity hardware, designed for easy and fault-tolerant access.  
o Function: It breaks large files into blocks and distributes these blocks across 
multiple machines in the cluster, also replicating them for fault tolerance. 
2. MapReduce: 
o Representation: Typically a yellow elephant logo with "Map Reduce" text. Labeled 
as "Data Processing. " 
o Purpose: MapReduce is a programming model and software framework 
for processing large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster.  
3. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): 
o Representation: Often a yellow elephant logo with "hadoop YARN" text. Labeled as 
"Cluster Resource Management. " 
o Purpose: Introduced in Hadoop 2.0, YARN's primary purpose is to manage cluster 
resources (CPU, memory) and schedule jobs/tasks running on the Hadoop 
cluster. 
o Decoupling: As data volumes and processing needs grew, YARN was introduced to 
separate resource management and job scheduling from the MapReduce data 
processing engine.  
Other Key Categories and Components in the Ecosystem Diagram: 
• Data Management/Access: Tools that provide different ways to access and manage data 
stored in Hadoop. 
o HBase: An orange icon, labeled "Columnar Store. " (A NoSQL database that runs on 
top of HDFS, providing random real-time read/write access to Big Data). 

o Hive: A bee logo, labeled "(SQL Query). " (A data warehouse system that facilitates 
reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using 
SQL-like queries). 
o Pig: A pig logo, labeled "(Scripting). " (A high-level platform for creating MapReduce 
programs used with Hadoop, using a scripting language called Pig Latin). 
• Data Ingestion: Tools for collecting and loading data into Hadoop. 
o Sqoop: An elephant logo with "Sqoop" text, labeled "(Data Collection). " (Designed 
for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured datastores 
such as relational databases). 
o Flume: An icon with "Flume" text, labeled "(Data Collection). " (A distributed, 
reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving 
large amounts of log data or streaming event data). 
• Workflow & Coordination: Tools for managing and coordinating complex Hadoop jobs. 
o Oozie: A gear-like icon, labeled "(Workflow). " (A workflow scheduler system to 
manage Apache Hadoop jobs). 
o Zookeeper: Zoo animal icons, labeled "(Coordination). " (A centralized service for 
maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed 
synchronization, and providing group services). 
• Machine Learning: 
o Mahout: An elephant head logo, labeled "(Machine Learning). " (A project to create 
scalable machine learning algorithms that run on Hadoop).
