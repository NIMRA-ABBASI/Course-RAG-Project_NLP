 Tom's Exploration of NoSQL Databases (Scenario Continued): 
The scenario of Tom, the software engineer facing scalability challenges with his relational 
database, continues. An image often depicts Tom at his desk, contemplating a "different solution, " 
with application icons nearby, setting the context of needing modern database solutions for 
modern applications. 
• Scalability Issues with Relational Databases: Tom's application, now a "big data app, " 
needs to process a tremendous amount of data. Scaling a traditional relational database to 
meet these demands has become very challenging and inefficient. 
• Discovery of NoSQL Databases: In his research, Tom discovers NoSQL databases. These 
databases are specifically designed to handle large numbers of requests with sub-
millisecond latency. A key characteristic of many NoSQL databases is their distributed 
nature. They achieve unbounded throughput and storage capacity by allowing the addition 
of more nodes (servers) to the cluster and distributing the workload and data across these 
nodes. 
Visuals often accompany this, illustrating NoSQL database characteristics: 
* Top Part ("NoSQL Databases"): Icons representing "Storage" (stacked disks) and "Throughput" 
(upward arrows) point towards a database symbol (cylinder labeled "NoSQL"). This symbol then 
points to "sub millisecond, " indicating fast response times. This conveys that NoSQL databases 
offer high storage capacity, high throughput, and low latency. 
* Bottom Part ("No Administrative Overhead"): Icons represent various administrative tasks that 
are often handled by managed NoSQL services: 
* "Provisioning" (server with a plus sign) 
* "Setup" (tools like wrench and screwdriver) 
* "Replication" (two servers with a circular arrow) 
* "Patching" (server with a medical cross/patch) 
* "Scaling" (server with upward arrows) 
This illustrates that managed NoSQL services like DynamoDB significantly reduce the 
administrative burden on the user by automating these tasks. 
DynamoDB: A Fully Managed NoSQL Database: 
• Key-Value and Document Model: DynamoDB is introduced as a fully managed key-value 
and document-based NoSQL database. It stores data in a denormalized fashion (which 
can improve read performance for specific query patterns by reducing the need for joins) 
and is designed to handle any scale of data and traffic. 

• Offloading Administrative Burdens: As Tom learns more, he discovers that DynamoDB 
helps offload the administrative burdens typically associated with operating and scaling 
a distributed database. With DynamoDB, Tom and his team no longer need to worry about: 
o Hardware provisioning 
o Setup and configuration 
o Replication management 
o Software patching 
o Cluster scaling 
These tasks are managed by AWS. 
• Security (Encryption at Rest): Since Tom’s company prioritizes security, a crucial feature 
is DynamoDB’s encryption at rest. This capability encrypts the data stored in DynamoDB 
tables, helping to protect sensitive data and eliminating the operational burden and 
complexity of managing encryption keys and processes manually. 
These features make DynamoDB an attractive option for applications requiring high scalability, 
low latency, and reduced operational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of 
data.
