Full Virtualization  
Virtualization Approaches: 
1. Full-Virtualization 
2. Para-Virtualization 
3. Binary Translation 
4. Hardware-Assisted Virtualization 
Full Virtualization 
In full virtualization, the virtual machine (VM) runs an unmodified guest operating system (OS) that 
believes it has full control over the hardware. This illusion is created by virtualization software, often 
called a hypervisor, which fully emulates the underlying hardware. As a result, the VM behaves just like 
itâ€™s running on physical hardware. 
Key Feature: The guest OS is completely unaware that itâ€™s operating within a virtualized environment. 
The hypervisor handles all interactions between the guest OS and the hardware. 
Examples of Full Virtualization Solutions: 
ï‚· VMware ESXi 
ï‚· KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) 
ï‚· Microsoft Hyper-V 
ðŸ“Š Image Description: 
The architecture diagram of Full Virtualization shows: 
ï‚· Bottom Layer (Red): Hardware base physical machine 
ï‚· Middle Layer (Blue): Virtual Machine Monitor (Hypervisor) 
ï‚· Top Layer (Green): Multiple identical blocks labeled "Guest OS (Same hardware architecture 
Supported)", with "Applications" (Purple blocks) on top 
ï‚· A blue VM management extensions box points to the Hypervisor layer 
This visual demonstrates how standard, unmodified guest OS instances operate on top of a hypervisor 
that emulates hardware, creating a seamless virtual environment.
