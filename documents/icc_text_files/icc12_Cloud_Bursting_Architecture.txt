Cloud Bursting Architecture 
Cloud Bursting is a hybrid cloud strategy that allows an organization's on-premise IT environment 
to dynamically extend its capacity by "bursting" into a public or private cloud when its local 
resources are insufficient to meet demand. This approach acts like a safety valve, enabling 
businesses to handle sudden or seasonal spikes in workload without having to permanently over-
provision their on-premise infrastructure. It combines the security and control of a private 
environment with the on-demand scalability of the cloud. 
How It Works: 
The cloud bursting process typically involves three key phases: 
1. Pre-Deployment of Cloud Resources: Cloud-based IT resources, such as virtual servers 
and storage, are set up in advance with a cloud provider but remain inactive or in a standby 
mode. These are like reserve players, ready to be called upon but not consuming significant 
resources until needed.  
2. Threshold-Based Activation ("Bursting Out"): When the demand on the on-premise 
resources reaches a predefined limit or threshold (e.g., 80% CPU capacity on internal 
servers), the system automatically triggers the activation of the pre-configured cloud 
resources. The workload is then seamlessly extended or offloaded to these cloud 
resources to manage the extra demand. This prevents the on-premise systems from being 
overwhelmed. 
3. Resource Deactivation ("Bursting In"): Once the peak demand subsides and the on-
premise resources can comfortably handle the workload again, the cloud resources are 
deactivated or scaled down. The system "bursts back in, " returning to primarily using its on-
premise infrastructure. For the retail company, after Blessed Friday ends and traffic returns 
to normal, the cloud servers are deactivated, and their own servers resume handling all 
customer traffic. 
Key Components: 
Two crucial components facilitate cloud bursting: 
• Automated Scaling Listener: This tool or service continuously monitors the load and 
performance metrics of the on-premise resources. It acts like a sensor, detecting when 
servers are nearing capacity and automatically deciding when to initiate the burst to the 
cloud by routing some requests or workloads there. 
• Resource Replication: This ensures that the applications, data, and configurations on the 
cloud resources are synchronized and consistent with the on-premise environment. This is 

vital so that when the burst occurs, the cloud resources are up-to-date and can seamlessly 
take over or augment the processing.
