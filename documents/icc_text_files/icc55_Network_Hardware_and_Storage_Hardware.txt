Network Hardware and Storage Hardware 
Network Hardware 
(Image Description: The left side of the slide features a stylized, close-up photograph of server racks in a 
data center. The servers have glowing blue and yellow indicator lights, creating a sense of advanced 
technology and high-density computing infrastructure.) 
Data centers require extensive network hardware in order to enable multiple levels of connectivity. The 
data center is broken down into five network subsystems: 
1. Carrier and External Networks Interconnection — Connects the data center to the outside 
world and other networks. 
2. Web-Tier Load Balancing and Acceleration — Distributes web traffic across multiple servers. 
3. LAN Fabric — Internal network that connects all servers and devices within the data center. 
4. SAN Fabric — Network that links storage devices (like hard disks) to servers for fast data access. 
5. NAS Gateways — Connects network-attached storage (NAS) systems to the network, allowing 
shared data access. 
Storage Hardware 
Data centers have specialized storage systems that maintain enormous amounts of digital information in 
order to fulfill considerable storage capacity needs. Storage systems are containers housing numerous 
hard disks that are organized into arrays. These arrays allow the systems to manage huge data volumes 
reliably and efficiently. 
Other Considerations: 
 IT Hardware Obsolescence: Technology changes quickly, so IT equipment usually becomes 
outdated in 5 to 7 years. Regular upgrades and replacements are essential for maintaining 
optimal performance. 
 Security Concerns: Data centers must protect a lot of data, making security very important. 
Physical security of the hardware and cyber security to prevent unauthorized access are critical.
