Elastic Disk Provisioning Architecture centers around the concept of providing storage to 
systems, particularly virtual servers, in a flexible and efficient manner. It allows storage capacity to 
be allocated dynamically, adjusting to actual needs rather than pre-allocating large, fixed amounts 
that might go unused. This is often achieved through a technique known as thin provisioning.  
Key Concepts: 
• Dynamic Storage: The core idea is that storage allocation isn't static. Instead, it adjusts 
based on the real-time storage requirements of the application or virtual server. As more 
data is written, more physical storage is allocated from a shared pool. 
• Thin-Provisioning: This is the mechanism that enables dynamic storage. When a virtual 
server is provisioned, it might be logically assigned a large amount of disk space (e.g., 450 
GB).  
• Usage Monitoring: To support this model and enable accurate billing, the system 
continuously tracks actual storage usage. This monitoring allows cloud providers to 
charge customers based on the physical storage consumed, rather than the total 
provisioned logical capacity. 
How it Works (Illustrated by Figure 11.14 & 11.15 context): 
Imagine a cloud consumer requests a virtual server that logically includes three hard disks, each 
with a capacity of 150 GB, totaling a provisioned disk space of 450 GB. 
1. Initial Provisioning (Logical Allocation): The virtual server is configured by the elastic disk 
provisioning architecture to see a total of 450 GB of available disk space. This 450 GB is set 
as the maximum disk usage allowed for this virtual server. 
2. No Initial Physical Allocation: Crucially, at this point, no actual physical disk space (or a 
near-zero amount for metadata) has been reserved or allocated from the underlying 
physical storage devices for this 450 GB. The system reports "used: 0 GB" physically. 
3. Data Writing and Physical Allocation: When the cloud consumer starts installing 
software or copying files onto the virtual server's disks, the actual used space begins to 
grow. As data is written, the thin-provisioning software, often interacting with a hypervisor 
and a dynamic disk allocation component, carves out physical storage from the underlying 
shared storage pool to accommodate this new data. 
4. Pay-Per-Use Monitoring: A pay-per-use monitor tracks the actual dynamically allocated 
physical storage. The consumer is billed based on this actual usage, not the initially 
provisioned 450 GB. If the consumer has used 0 GB, they are not charged for disk space 
usage (beyond any base fees for the virtual server itself).
