Key Technologies in Service Communication: 
Several standard protocols and data formats are commonly used to enable communication and 
data exchange in Service-Oriented Architectures and Web Services: 
• SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): 
o Definition: SOAP is a protocol specifically designed for exchanging structured 
information in the implementation of Web Services. It typically uses XML (Extensible 
Markup Language) as its message format to define the structure of requests and 
responses. 
o Functionality: It allows applications to communicate with each other over a 
network, often over HTTP , though it can be used with other transport protocols. 
• WSDL (Web Services Description Language): 
o Definition: WSDL is an XML-based language used to describe the capabilities of a 
web service. It acts as a contract, detailing what functions the service offers, how to 
make requests (message formats, data types), what data to send, and how to 
interpret the responses. 
o Functionality: WSDL files provide a machine-readable description of the service's 
interface, enabling automated tools to generate client-side proxies or stubs for 
interacting with the service. 
• JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): 
o Definition: JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to 
read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
o Usage: While SOAP traditionally uses XML, JSON has become a very popular 
alternative for data exchange in web services, particularly in RESTful APIs, due to its 
simplicity and conciseness. 
• HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): 
o Definition: HTTP is the foundational protocol used for transferring data over the 
web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions web 
servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. 
o Usage in Web Services: Web services, whether SOAP-based or RESTful, frequently 
use HTTP (or its secure version, HTTPS) as the transport protocol for sending 
requests to service URLs and receiving responses. 

SOAP Web Service Clarification: 
When the term "SOAP web service" is used, it specifically refers to a web service that utilizes 
the SOAP protocol for communication. This implies that the service sends and receives 
messages formatted as SOAP messages, which are structured in XML. 
SOAP vs JSON: 
This section contrasts SOAP and JSON, two common ways to structure data for web service 
communication: 
• SOAP: 
o Is a protocol that uses XML for its message format. 
o Has built-in features and standards for aspects like security (WS-Security), 
reliability (WS-ReliableMessaging), and transactions (WS-AtomicTransaction). This 
makes it more comprehensive but also more complex. 
• JSON: 
o Is purely a data format, not a protocol itself. 
o Is lightweight, simpler to use, and easier for humans to read compared to XML.
