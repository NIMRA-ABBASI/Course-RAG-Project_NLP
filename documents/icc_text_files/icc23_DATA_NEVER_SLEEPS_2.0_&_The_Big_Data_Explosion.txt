DATA NEVER SLEEPS 2.0: How Much Data is Generated Every Minute? 
This section, often presented as a graphic or infographic (associated with DOMO), dramatically 
illustrates the sheer volume and velocity of data being generated across various online platforms 
and digital activities every single minute of every day. The core message is that data creation is a 
continuous, often unnoticed, byproduct of our daily digital interactions. The text emphasizes that 
"Big Data" is not just about massive size but also describes the "massive avalanche of digital 
activity pulsating through cables and airwaves. " It also points to the new types of measurements 
and insights now possible; "all the things we were never able to measure before. " 
Every online action—sharing a status, reading an article, uploading a photo—contributes to a 
"digital trail that tells a story. " The "DATA NEVER SLEEPS" concept aims to quantify this 
phenomenon by showcasing statistics for data generated per minute across popular services. This 
highlights the dynamic, high-velocity nature of data in the modern world, underscoring the 
challenge and opportunity of harnessing this constant flow of information. The content is typically 
framed by decorative elements, emphasizing its a regular, updated report on the state of internet 
data generation. 
The Big Data Explosion 
This section formally defines "Big Data" and illustrates the challenges it presents. Big Data is 
characterized by the "three V's": 
• Volume: Refers to the enormous quantity of data being generated and stored. 
• Variety: Pertains to the diverse types of data, ranging from structured (like database 
entries) to unstructured (like text, images, videos) and semi-structured (like JSON or XML 
files). 
• Velocity: Describes the high speed at which data is generated, processed, and consumed. 
An accompanying image often uses the "needle in a haystack" metaphor to explain the challenge. 
"Small data" is depicted as a small pile of hay with an easily visible needle. In contrast, "big data" 
is shown as an overwhelmingly large haystack, with a stressed individual using a pitchfork, 
highlighting the immense difficulty and time (e.g., "Congratulations, it only took you 65298 
seconds" to find the needle) involved in finding valuable information or insights within such vast 
and complex datasets. This metaphor effectively communicates how the challenge of extracting 
value from data increases dramatically with its size, variety, and velocity. The increasing scale and 
complexity of Big Data necessitate advanced analytical tools and techniques to manage and 
derive meaningful insights from these exploding data volumes.
