NIST Cloud Model: Essential Characteristics 
NIST outlines five essential characteristics of cloud computing: 
 On-demand self-service: Users can obtain computing resources automatically without needing 
to interact with the provider. 
 Broad network access: Resources are available over the internet and accessible via multiple 
devices like phones, tablets, and laptops. 
 Resource pooling: Providers pool resources to serve multiple customers dynamically, 
abstracting the physical location of resources. 
 Rapid elasticity: Resources can scale up or down quickly based on demand, often automatically. 
 Measured service: Cloud systems monitor resource usage for transparency and billing, 
optimizing resource allocation. 
These features enable cloud computing’s scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
