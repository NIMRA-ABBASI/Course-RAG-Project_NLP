Basic Terms and Concepts in Security (Continued): 
This section continues defining fundamental security terms relevant to cloud environments: 
• Authentication: 
o Definition: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, process, 
or device. It ensures that something or someone is genuinely who or what it claims 
to be, confirming it's from an authorized source. 
• Availability: 
o Definition: Availability is the characteristic of a system or resource 
being accessible and usable during a specified time period by authorized users. 
It means services are operational when needed. 
• Threat: 
o Definition: A threat is a potential danger or event that can harm the 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information, systems, or privacy. 
• Vulnerability: 
o Definition: A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, security procedures, 
design, or implementation that an attacker can exploit to cause harm. 
• Risk: 
o Definition: Risk is the chance or likelihood of harm occurring if a specific threat 
exploits a particular vulnerability. It combines the probability of an event with the 
expected impact or loss. 
o Metrics for Determining Risk: Two key metrics are often used: 
1. The probability of a threat successfully occurring to exploit vulnerabilities in 
an IT resource. 
2. The expectation of loss or damage if the IT resource is compromised. 
Threat Agents: 
Threat agents are the entities or individuals that actively pose security risks to a system by seeking 
to exploit vulnerabilities. They can be external to the organization or internal. 
• Definition: Entities or individuals that can initiate a threat action. 
The document then defines specific types of threat agents: 

• Anonymous Attacker: 
o Definition: An individual who conducts malicious activities without revealing their 
true identity, often using techniques to obscure their origin. 
• Malicious Service Agent: 
o Definition: A service or application (which could be a legitimate service 
compromised, or a purpose-built malicious one) that intentionally causes harm or 
exploits system weaknesses. This could be a piece of malware or a rogue software 
agent. 
• Malicious Tenants: 
o Definition: In a multi-tenant cloud environment (where multiple customers share 
the same underlying infrastructure), malicious tenants refer to customers or users 
of the system who abuse their access or the shared resources to harm other 
tenants or the cloud provider's system itself. 
• Malicious Insider: 
o Definition: An employee, contractor, or other authorized user within an organization 
who exploits their legitimate access privileges to compromise security, steal 
data, or cause damage. Insiders often have knowledge of internal systems and 
security measures, making their attacks potentially very damaging.
