Para-Virtualization  
Para-Virtualization 
In para-virtualization, the guest OS is modified to recognize that it's running in a virtualized 
environment. This key difference allows the OS to directly communicate with the hypervisor, 
which bypasses the need to emulate hardware, resulting in improved performance. 
 Key Concepts: 
 Hypercalls: These are system-call-like instructions sent from the guest OS to the 
hypervisor instead of the hardware. They're used to request services such as memory 
management and I/O operations. 
 Optimized Code Paths: Para-virtualized OS may include special drivers and 
optimizations that allow better performance in a virtualized setting. 
Performance Advantage: Since the OS is aware of the virtualization and cooperates with the 
hypervisor, less work is needed to intercept or emulate instructions, leading to faster execution 
and lower overhead compared to full virtualization. Image Description: 
 Bottom Layer (Red): Hardware base physical machine 
 Above it (Purple): Modified hardware layer 
 Middle Layer (Blue): Virtual Machine Monitor (Hypervisor) 
 Top Layer (Green): "Modified Guest OS (Same hardware architecture Supported)" 
blocks, each with "Applications" (Purple blocks) on top 
 A blue box labeled VM management extensions points to the hypervisor layer 
This setup shows modified guest OS instances designed to work efficiently in virtualized 
environments, often using hypercalls for smoother communication. And they are effective.
