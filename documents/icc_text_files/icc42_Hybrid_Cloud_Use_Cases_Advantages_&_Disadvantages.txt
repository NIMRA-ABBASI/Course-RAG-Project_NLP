Use Cases for Hybrid Cloud: 
The hybrid cloud model provides a versatile solution that allows organizations to balance the 
benefits of both public and private clouds, making it suitable for various scenarios: 
• Online Store (E-commerce): An online retailer might store sensitive customer data (like 
payment information and personal details) in a secure private cloud to meet compliance 
and security requirements. Simultaneously, they can run their customer-facing website 
applications (like the product catalog and shopping cart) in a public cloud to leverage its 
scalability for handling traffic spikes during sales and its cost-effectiveness for web 
hosting. 
• University: A university could store confidential student records and administrative data 
on-premise in a private cloud for better control and security. However, they might use 
the public cloud to run online courses, learning management systems (LMS), and 
collaborative tools, benefiting from the public cloud's accessibility and ability to scale to 
support many students. 
• Manufacturing Firm: A factory might use a private cloud to manage proprietary data, such 
as intellectual property, design blueprints, and sensitive operational control systems. For 
computationally intensive tasks like large-scale simulations (e.g., product design testing or 
supply chain optimization), they could rely on the vast resources of the public cloud. 
• Insurance Company: An insurance firm can keep sensitive client data and policy 
information on a private cloud for security and regulatory compliance. During peak times, 
such as open enrollment periods or when processing a large volume of quotes, they can 
utilize the public cloud's scalable computing resources for processing these quotes 
efficiently. 
Advantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model: 
The hybrid approach offers several key benefits: 
• Flexibility and Control: Businesses gain more flexibility to design personalized 
solutions that meet their particular needs. They can choose the optimal environment 
(public or private) for each workload, balancing control over sensitive assets with the agility 
of public cloud services. 
• Cost Optimization: Because public clouds provide excellent scalability, organizations 
are only responsible for paying for the extra capacity if and when they require it (e.g., 
for bursting or temporary workloads). This can be more cost-effective than maintaining 
extensive on-premise infrastructure for peak loads. 

• Security: By properly separating data and workloads—keeping sensitive data in the private 
cloud and less sensitive operations in the public cloud—the chances of data theft by 
attackers can be considerably reduced for critical assets. 
Disadvantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model: 
Despite its advantages, the hybrid cloud also presents challenges: 
• Difficult to Manage (Complexity): Hybrid clouds are inherently difficult to 
manage because they are a combination of both public and private cloud environments, 
potentially involving different providers, technologies, and management tools.
