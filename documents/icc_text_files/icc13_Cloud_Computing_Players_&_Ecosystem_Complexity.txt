Cloud Computing Players & Ecosystem Complexity 
The cloud computing landscape is vibrant and highly diverse, with numerous players contributing across 
different layers of the ecosystem. These players include hardware vendors, virtualization software 
providers, cloud platforms, and service models such as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. A visual snapshot of the 
cloud ecosystem illustrates this complexity, showing a grid of companies categorized by their roles. 
In the Cloud Marketplace, companies like AppDirect, APPiRiO, and INGRAM MICRO Partner Smart help 
businesses discover, purchase, and manage cloud applications and services. These marketplaces 
streamline cloud adoption for enterprises by providing easy access to a variety of tools and platforms. 
Cloud Broker Platforms such as cloudMatrix and Jamcracker act as intermediaries that aggregate 
services from multiple providers. They enable customers to manage hybrid and multi-cloud 
environments more efficiently. 
In the Cloud Management domain, platforms like Apptio Cloudability, Cloudswitch, Cloudyn, and 
RightScale help organizations track usage, costs, and performance across cloud environments. These 
tools play a critical role in maintaining visibility and optimizing cloud infrastructure. 
Cloud services themselves are categorized into layers: 
 SaaS (Software as a Service): This includes Google, NetSuite, Salesforce, and Taleo—providers 
that offer applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installation or local 
infrastructure. 
 PaaS (Platform as a Service): Platforms like Azure, Force.com, Google App Engine, and Heroku 
provide developers with environments to build and deploy applications without managing the 
underlying hardware or software. 
 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Providers such as Amazon Web Services, GoGrid, Joyent, 
Rackspace, and Terremark offer computing infrastructure like servers and storage on a pay-as-
you-go basis. 
Beneath these service layers lie the foundational technologies: 
 Cloud Platforms like OpenStack, Eucalyptus, and VMware vCloud support the deployment and 
orchestration of cloud services. 
 Virtualization Tools including VMware, Xen, Citrix XenServer, Hyper-V, and KVM allow multiple 
virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, increasing hardware efficiency. 
 Hardware Vendors such as IBM, Dell, Oracle, and HP supply blade servers and data center 
infrastructure that power the physical side of cloud computing. 
This diverse ecosystem highlights the maturity of the cloud model and its broad applicability across 
industries and use cases.
