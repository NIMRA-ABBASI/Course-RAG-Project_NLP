Web Applications and Multitenant Technology (Part 1) 
Web Applications 
(Image Description: "Figure 5.10 The three basic architectural tiers of Web applications." The diagram 
illustrates a three-tier architecture: 
 Top: "presentation layer" (lightest orange) 
 Middle: "application layer" (medium orange) 
 Bottom: "data layer" (darker orange) 
A horizontal line separates the area above the "application layer" from the "application layer" 
itself. On the right, components aligned with layers: 
 "Web client" on client side (presentation layer) 
 "Web/application server" on server side (application layer) 
 "Data storage server" on server side (data layer) 
This diagram visually represents the logical separation of concerns in typical web application 
architecture, from user interface (presentation) to business logic (application) to data 
management (data).) 
Multitenant Technology 
(Image Description: The background of the slide is black, featuring a dynamic, abstract design of white 
and blue light streaks flowing across the screen, possibly representing fiber optics, data streams, or high-
speed network activity. The title "Multitenant Technology" is in white text overlaid on this background.) 
Multitenancy allows multiple users (tenants) to access the same application logic simultaneously. Each 
tenant has its own view of the application that it uses, administers, and customizes as a dedicated 
instance of the software. Multitenant applications ensure that tenants do not have access to data and 
configuration information that is not their own. 
Tenants can individually customize features such as: 
 User Interface: Tenants can define a specialized “look and feel” for their application interface. 
 Business Process: Customize rules, logic, and workflows of business processes implemented in 
the application. 
 Data Model: Extend the data schema to include, exclude, or rename fields. 
 Access Control: Independently control access rights for users and groups.
