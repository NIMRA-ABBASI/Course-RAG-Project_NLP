4. Information Disclosure (Exposure of Sensitive Information) - Mitigation Techniques: 
This threat involves the unauthorized exposure of confidential or sensitive data. 
• Encryption: 
o Technique: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (e.g., using SSL/TLS for web 
traffic) and at rest (e.g., using AWS KMS for encrypting data in S3 or RDS). This 
makes data unreadable even if accessed by unauthorized parties. 
• Access Control: 
o Technique: Apply strict, granular access control policies, often using Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) systems, to limit who can access sensitive data and 
what actions they can perform. This adheres to the principle of least privilege. 
• Data Masking or Redaction: 
o Technique: Mask or redact sensitive portions of data when it’s being displayed or 
used by unauthorized or less-privileged users or in non-production environments 
(e.g., showing only the last four digits of a credit card number). 
5. Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - Mitigation Techniques: 
These attacks aim to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. 
• Rate Limiting: 
o Technique: Use tools like API gateways, web application firewalls (WAFs), and load 
balancers to limit the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a 
specific time frame, thus mitigating an attacker's ability to flood the service. 
• Redundancy and Scaling: 
o Technique: Implement auto-scaling for resources to automatically handle 
increased traffic. Deploying resources across multiple availability zones or regions 
provides redundancy and reduces the risk of service outages due to localized 
attacks or failures. 
• DDoS Protection Services: 
o Technique: Utilize specialized services designed to detect and mitigate DDoS 
attacks, such as AWS Shield or third-party solutions like Cloudflare. These services 
can absorb and filter malicious traffic. 

6. Elevation of Privilege (Unauthorized Access or Escalated Permissions) - Mitigation 
Techniques: 
This threat involves an attacker or user gaining more access rights than they are legitimately 
entitled to. 
• Least Privilege Access: 
o Technique: Ensure users, roles, and services are granted only the minimum level of 
access and permissions required for their specific job function or task. 
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
o Technique: Use RBAC to assign specific predefined roles (with associated 
permissions) to users based on their responsibilities within the organization or 
system. This provides a structured way to manage permissions. 
• Regular Access Reviews: 
o Technique: Continuously review and audit user permissions and access rights to 
identify and revoke excessive or unnecessary privileges, thereby preventing privilege 
escalation or misuse of stale permissions. 
Cloud Security Mechanisms (Core Tools/Concepts): 
The document then introduces fundamental mechanisms used to implement security in the 
cloud: 
• Encryption: 
o Definition: The process of converting data from a readable format (plaintext) into a 
secure, unreadable format (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access. It ensures 
that data is unintelligible to anyone who does not possess the proper decryption 
key. 
• IAM (Identity and Access Management): 
o Definition: IAM is a framework of policies and technologies that helps manage and 
control user identities and their access to cloud resources. It ensures that the right 
people (or services) have the right level of access to the right resources at the right 
time. 
• SSO (Single Sign-On): 

o Definition: SSO allows users to authenticate once (e.g., by logging into their 
corporate network) and then gain access to multiple related but independent 
software systems or cloud services without needing to log in again for each one.
