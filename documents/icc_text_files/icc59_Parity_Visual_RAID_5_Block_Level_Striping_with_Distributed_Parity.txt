Parity in RAID - Visual Explanation: 
The document describes an image illustrating the concept of parity bits distributed across disks: 
• Five cylindrical icons represent disks, labeled "Disk 1" through "Disk 5" . 
• Each disk has five horizontal segments, each containing a binary '0' or '1' , representing data 
bits. 
o Example data: 
▪ Disk 1: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 
▪ Disk 2: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 
▪ Disk 3: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 
▪ Disk 4: 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 
▪ Disk 5 (example parity calculation or dedicated parity for some levels): 0, 1, 
1, 0, 1 
• Interpretation: This visual is a simplified representation. It aims to show how data bits are 
distributed and how parity bits (which would be calculated based on the data bits, e.g., via 
XOR) could be stored.  
RAID 5 (Block-Level Striping with Distributed Parity): Details 
RAID 5 is a popular RAID level that offers a good balance of performance, storage capacity, and 
data redundancy. 
• Data Distribution: In RAID 5, data is striped at the block level across all disks in the 
array, similar to RAID 0. However, it also calculates parity information for each stripe of 
data blocks. Crucially, this parity information is distributed across all the disks in the 
array, rather than being stored on a single dedicated parity disk (as in RAID 3 or RAID 4). For 
each stripe, one disk will store the parity block, and the other disks will store data blocks. 
The disk storing the parity block rotates for each stripe. 
• Performance: 
o Read Performance: Good, as data can be read in parallel from multiple disks. 
o Write Performance: Slower than RAID 0 or RAID 1 for random writes. This is 
because each write operation requires reading the old data block, reading the old 
parity block, calculating the new parity, writing the new data block, and writing the 
new parity block (Read-Modify-Write sequence). 

• Fault Tolerance: RAID 5 can tolerate the failure of one single disk in the array. If a disk 
fails, the missing data on that disk can be rebuilt using the parity information and the data 
from the remaining functional disks in the stripe. The system can continue to operate in a 
degraded mode (with reduced performance) until the failed disk is replaced and the data is 
reconstructed onto the new disk. 
• Minimum Disks: Requires a minimum of three disks. 
• Storage Efficiency: If N is the number of disks, the usable capacity is (N-1) times the 
capacity of the smallest disk. For example, with three 1TB disks, you get 2TB of usable 
space.
