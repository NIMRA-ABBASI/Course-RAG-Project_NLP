 The Mission Willpower (Google's Innovation) 
This section delves into Google's drive and commitment—termed "mission willpower"—to 
continually innovate and optimize its data center operations, particularly focusing on efficiency 
and cost reduction. 
• Early Challenges: It highlights that back in 1999, Google's search system often took a full 
3.5 seconds to deliver results and was prone to crashes, especially on Mondays (likely due 
to weekend indexing or peak load). This illustrates the early performance hurdles they 
faced. 
• Core Strategy: To overcome these challenges and support its massive scale, Google made 
a strategic decision to build and operate its own data centers. This gave them complete 
control over design and operations. 
• Innovation Focus: A crucial part of this strategy was to innovate relentlessly to reduce 
setup and operational costs. Google is recognized for having probably more server 
machines than any other company. 
• Contributing Factors to Success: Several factors contribute to Google's success in data 
center efficiency: 
o Efficiency and Optimization: Constant efforts to improve hardware and software 
efficiency. 
o Network Infrastructure: Designing and managing their own high-speed global 
network. 
o Software and Algorithms: Developing highly optimized software and sophisticated 
algorithms for data processing and management. 
o Data Center Design: Pioneering innovative approaches to data center 
construction, power, and cooling. 
o Distributed Computing: Expertise in building and managing massive distributed 
systems. 
Electricity Management (Focus on Cooling) 
A significant portion of a data center's operational cost and environmental impact comes from 
electricity consumption, with cooling being a major component.. 
• Traditional Cooling: Traditionally, data centers were cooled using giant computer room air 
conditioners (CRACs), which consume massive amounts of energy. This often resulted in 
very cold server rooms where workers might wear shorts and T-shirts. 

• Hot Aisle / Cold Aisle Design: Google (and the industry) adopted the "hot aisle / cold 
aisle" layout. 
o Cold Aisle: Where cold air is supplied to the front of the server racks to cool the 
equipment. 
o Hot Aisle: Where the hot air expelled from the back of the servers is collected. 
This arrangement optimizes cooling efficiency by preventing hot and cold air from 
mixing 
• Liquid Cooling Innovation: The heat collected from the hot aisles can be absorbed by 
coils filled with water. This heated water is then pumped out of the building to cooling 
towers or other heat exchange systems where it is cooled before being recirculated. This is 
more efficient than just blasting cold air. 
• Further Cooling Innovations: Google figured out further money-saving ways to cool that 
water. Instead of traditional energy-intensive chillers, Google’s big data centers often 
employ giant cooling towers where hot water trickles down through a medium, allowing 
evaporation to cool the water (similar to vast radiators).
