Cloud Security Threats (Specific Attack Vectors): 
This section delves into specific types of attacks and security threats commonly encountered in 
cloud computing environments: 
• Traffic Eavesdropping: 
o Definition: Occurs when unauthorized parties intercept and listen to data 
transmitted over networks. If the data is unencrypted, the eavesdropper can read its 
contents. 
• Malicious Intermediary (Man-in-the-Middle Attack): 
o Definition: A malicious intermediary is a third-party entity that positions itself 
between two communicating systems (e.g., a user and a cloud service) to intercept, 
monitor, or alter the communication without their knowledge. 
• Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): 
o Definition: A DoS attack aims to overwhelm a system, network, or service with an 
excessive amount of traffic or requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. A 
DDoS attack uses multiple compromised computer systems (a botnet) to launch 
the attack. 
• Insufficient Authorization Attack: 
o Definition: This occurs when unauthorized users gain access to restricted 
resources, data, or functionalities due to weak or improperly configured access 
controls and authorization mechanisms. 
• Virtualization Attack: 
o Definition: These attacks specifically target vulnerabilities within the virtualized 
environment of cloud computing, such as flaws in the hypervisor (the software that 
creates and manages virtual machines). 
• Overlapping Trust Boundaries: 
o Definition: Overlapping trust boundaries occur when multiple systems, services, or 
users within a cloud environment share trust in a way that inadvertently creates 
security risks or allows for unintended data leakage. This can happen if trust 
relationships are too broad or not granular enough. 
Cloud Threat Modeling: Introduction 

• Definition: Cloud Threat Modeling is a systematic process used to identify, analyze, and 
prioritize potential security risks and threats in cloud-based systems and applications. It 
involves understanding how an attacker might attempt to compromise the system and then 
finding ways to mitigate those threats. 
• Purpose: The goal is to proactively find and fix security vulnerabilities before they can be 
exploited. 
Threat Modelling Frameworks and Methodologies: 
When conducting cloud threat modeling, organizations don't have to start from scratch. They can 
use various established frameworks and methodologies to systematically identify, analyze, 
document, and prioritize potential threats. These frameworks provide a structured approach to 
thinking about security risks. 
One widely recognized framework mentioned is STRIDE, which categorizes threats into six types: 
• Spoofing: Pretending to be someone or something else (e.g., a user, a service). 
• Tampering: Secretly or illicitly modifying data or code. 
• Repudiation: Denying that an action was taken when it actually was. 
• Information Disclosure: Exposing sensitive or confidential data to unauthorized parties. 
• Denial of Service (DoS - as a threat category): Preventing legitimate users from accessing 
a system or service. 
• Elevation of Privilege (EoP): Gaining higher-level access rights or permissions than 
originally authorized.
