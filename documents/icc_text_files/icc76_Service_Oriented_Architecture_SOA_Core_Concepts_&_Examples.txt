Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Fundamental Definitions 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a software design paradigm based on the concept of 
"services" as fundamental building blocks. 
1. Service: 
o In SOA, a service is defined as the smallest functional unit. It represents a 
distinct, well-defined piece of business functionality or capability. 
o Crucially, a service is designed to be self-contained, meaning it can perform its 
specific function independently without relying on the context or state of other 
services. An example would be a service that retrieves a bank statement online; this 
service performs one specific task. 
2. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): 
o SOA itself is a design approach or architectural style where complex applications 
are built by combining these reusable, independent "services. " These services 
often communicate with each other over a network to perform larger tasks. 
o It emphasizes service-based development, focusing on the outcomes and 
functionality delivered by each service, rather than on the underlying technology or 
implementation details of individual components. 
3. SOA Applications: 
o An SOA application is typically created by orchestrating or 
choreographing multiple services together to perform more complex, end-to-end 
business processes or tasks. The modularity of services allows for flexible 
composition. 
Examples of SOA in Action: 
A common example illustrating SOA principles is an E-commerce Website: 
1. Service 1: Search for Products. This service would be responsible for accepting search 
queries from users and returning a list of relevant products from the product catalog. 
2. Service 2: Handle Payments. This service would manage the payment processing, 
interacting with payment gateways, validating payment details, and confirming 
transactions. 

3. Combined Functionality: Together, these (and potentially other services like inventory 
management, user authentication, and order fulfillment) create a complete online 
shopping experience. 
SOA Terms: Core Vocabulary 
Understanding SOA involves familiarity with a few key terms: 
1. Service (Revisited): 
o It represents a business function that performs a specific task. 
o It processes requests from a "consumer" (an entity that needs the service) 
and provides responses. 
o Example: A weather service that accepts a location request (e.g., city name) from a 
mobile app (the consumer) and returns the current weather forecast for that 
location. 
2. Provider: 
o The entity (or system) that offers and executes the service in response to a 
consumer’s request. It owns and manages the implementation of the service. 
o Example: A bank's server system acts as the provider for an account balance 
service, which might be consumed by the bank's mobile app or website. 
3. Consumer: 
o The entity (or application) that uses or invokes the service provided by the 
provider to achieve a particular goal. 
o Example: A mobile banking app (the consumer) uses the bank’s account balance 
service (provided by the bank's servers) to display account information to the user.
