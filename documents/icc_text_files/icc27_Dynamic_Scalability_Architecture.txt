Dynamic Scalability Architecture 
Dynamic Scalability Architecture is designed to automatically adjust the amount of 
computational resources allocated to an application in real-time, based on its current demand. 
The core principle is analogous to "adding more seats to a bus when more passengers arrive"—the 
system expands or contracts its capacity to match the workload precisely. This ensures that the 
application can handle fluctuating traffic and processing needs efficiently, maintaining 
performance without over-provisioning resources during periods of low demand. This architecture 
is crucial for applications with predictable, yet variable, load patterns, such as e-commerce sites 
during sales or streaming services during peak hours. 
An automated scaling listener is a key component of this architecture. This listener continuously 
monitors the performance metrics of the cloud service or application, such as CPU utilization, 
memory usage, or network traffic. It compares these metrics against predefined capacity 
thresholds. If these thresholds are exceeded, indicating an increase in demand, the listener 
triggers a scaling event. 
Scenario: E-commerce Blessed Friday Sale 
Consider an online retailer preparing for a "Blessed Friday Sale, " expecting a massive surge in user 
traffic precisely at midnight when the sale begins. Their website is built using Dynamic Scalability 
Architecture. 
• Auto-Scaling Policy: The system has an auto-scaling policy based on CPU utilization. For 
instance, if the CPU usage on a server exceeds a predefined threshold, say 80%, new 
instances of the web application are automatically launched to distribute the load. 
• Load Balancer: A load balancer is in place to evenly distribute the incoming user traffic 
across all active server instances, including the newly scaled ones. This prevents any single 
server from being overwhelmed. 
• Pre-Sale State: At 11:50 PM, before the sale starts, the system might be running with a 
baseline of 5 server instances, sufficient to handle regular, non-peak traffic. 
• Traffic Surge & Scaling Out: At 12:01 AM, as the sale goes live, traffic surges dramatically. 
The CPU utilization on the existing servers spikes to 90%, exceeding the 80% threshold. The 
auto-scaling system detects this and, according to its policy, automatically spins up an 
additional 10 server instances.  
• Traffic Decrease & Scaling In: By 3:00 AM, the initial rush subsides, traffic decreases, and 
CPU usage across the server instances drops below a lower threshold, for example, 30%. 
The auto-scaling system then terminates 8 of the surplus instances, leaving 7 active 
instances to manage the remaining, now moderate, traffic.
