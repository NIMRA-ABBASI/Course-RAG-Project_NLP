Cloud Storage Overview and Types 
Cloud storage enables on-demand data storage on remote infrastructures managed by providers like 
AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. There are three primary types of cloud storage: block storage, 
file storage, and object storage. Understanding these types is crucial for selecting the storage solution 
that best fits your needs. Businesses often require multiple storage types based on data usage and the 
nature of the data itself. 
A visual representation includes a central cloud icon labeled "Cloud storage" with "Storage as a Service" 
written below. Arrows point from various data sources (e.g., chat bubbles, code symbols, graphs) 
towards the central cloud, and from the cloud to the three storage types: 
 Block Storage: Represented by interconnected cubes. 
 File Storage: Depicted with a folder icon. 
 Object Storage: Illustrated with a bucket icon. This diagram summarizes how various data types 
are stored "as a Service" in the cloud, categorized into Block, File, or Object storage. 
 
 
Object Storage Overview 
Object storage is ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured data, such as videos, images, static web 
pages, text, audio files, and emails. Examples include AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage. Objects contain 
the data itself, metadata (e.g., video recording locations, actors), and a unique object identifier. 
Structure: 
 Objects are stored in buckets, modular units often distributed across storage systems to ensure 
better scalability, fault tolerance, and availability. 
 Each bucket organizes and groups objects, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and management 
in a scalable and structured way. 
 Object storage offers direct data access via APIs, making data accessible from web applications 
on any device simultaneously. 
Advantages: 
 Highly scalable, rapidly scaling to petabytes of data at a competitive price. 
 Extensive use of metadata makes data retrieval more straightforward. 
Limitations: 
 Not ideal for low-latency or high-performance needs like databases. 
 Objects cannot be modified; a new object must be created for any changes. 
 HTTP is used for data access, adding more latency due to the higher-level protocol and 
distributed nature of object storage.
