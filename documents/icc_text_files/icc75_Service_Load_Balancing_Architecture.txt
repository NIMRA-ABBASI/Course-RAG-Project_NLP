Service Load Balancing Architecture focuses specifically on distributing incoming network 
traffic or service requests across multiple servers or service instances. While it contributes to 
efficient resource utilization, its primary goals are to enhance fault tolerance, high availability, 
and reliability of services. Unlike dynamic scalability which aims to adjust the number of 
resources, service load balancing primarily ensures that the existing resources are used 
effectively and that the service remains accessible even if some components fail.  
In this architecture, services (or instances of a service) are intentionally distributed across 
multiple servers rather than concentrating multiple instances of the same service on a single 
server. This design choice is rooted in the need to optimize performance by preventing any single 
server from being overwhelmed, and crucially, to ensure the service remains available if one 
server experiences an issue. It deals with distributing network traffic or service requests across 
these distributed servers or services. 
Fault Tolerance and High Availability: 
The core benefit of this architecture lies in its ability to handle failures gracefully. 
• Problem with Single Server: If all instances of a critical service are hosted on a single 
server, and that server goes down (due to hardware failure, power outage, etc.), the entire 
service becomes unavailable, leading to significant disruption. 
• Solution with Multiple Servers: By distributing instances of the service across multiple, 
independent servers, the system builds inherent redundancy. If one server fails, the load 
balancer (which sits in front of these servers) detects the failure and automatically 
redirects incoming traffic and requests to the healthy instances running on other servers. 
This ensures that the service remains available to users, minimizing downtime. 
Scenario Example: 
Imagine an e-commerce platform. The checkout service is critical for completing sales. 
• Single Server Risk: If all instances of the checkout service are hosted exclusively on Server 
A, and Server A crashes, no customer can complete their purchase. The entire checkout 
functionality becomes unavailable. 
• Multiple Server Solution: By deploying instances of the checkout service across three 
separate servers (Server A, Server B, and Server C), and placing a load balancer in front of 
them, the platform becomes much more resilient. If Server A fails, the load balancer will 
automatically route all checkout requests to the instances running on Server B and Server 
C. Users can still complete their transactions seamlessly, often without even noticing that 
a backend server has failed.
