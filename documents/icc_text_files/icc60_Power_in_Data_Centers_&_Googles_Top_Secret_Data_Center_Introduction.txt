Power in Data Centers 
Power consumption is a critical aspect of data center operations and efficiency. A key metric used 
to measure this efficiency is Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). PUE is a ratio calculated by 
dividing the total facility power by the IT equipment power. 
• PUE Explained: A PUE of 1.7, for example, means that for every 1 unit of power used by the 
IT equipment (servers, storage, networking gear), an additional 0.7 units are consumed by 
supporting infrastructure like cooling systems, lighting, and power distribution losses. 
• Ideal PUE: The ideal PUE is 1.0, which would mean all power entering the data center goes 
directly to the IT equipment with no overhead. While unachievable in practice, the closer 
the PUE is to 1.0, the more efficient the data center is. 
• Server Power Consumption: A conventional server can consume between 200 to 500 
Watts (W) of power. Network switches, when their total power consumption is amortized 
across the servers they support, add approximately 10-20W per server. 
A pie chart often illustrates the typical power consumption distribution in a data center: 
• Servers and Data Equipment: This is usually the largest consumer, often 
around 55% (represented by the largest blue segment in the described visual). 
• HVAC (Cooling - Fans, compressors, etc.): Cooling is the second-largest consumer, 
typically around 30% (large yellow segment). 
• Lighting: A smaller portion, around 3% (small red segment). 
• Other: This category, including power distribution losses and other auxiliary systems, 
might account for about 12% (grey segment). 
This breakdown clearly shows that IT equipment and the cooling systems required to keep them 
operational are the two primary power consumers in a typical data center. Improving PUE involves 
optimizing both IT equipment efficiency and, significantly, cooling infrastructure. 
Google’s Top-Secret Data Center (Introduction & Scale) 
This section introduces the concept of Google's highly advanced and massive data center 
infrastructure, often portrayed as somewhat secretive or at least not openly accessible, 
emphasizing their scale and technological sophistication. The text often includes a visual like a 
screenshot of a Google Chrome browser window, with the Google search homepage visible, 
overlaid with text highlighting the immense scale of their operations. 
Phrases like: 

• "Google’s Top-Secret Data Center" 
• "This is what makes Google Google. " 
• "Thousands of fiber miles, thousands of servers" 
This multi-billion-dollar infrastructure enables Google to perform incredible feats of data 
processing and service delivery, including: 
• Indexing 20 billion web pages a day. 
• Handling more than 9 billion daily search queries. 
• Conducting millions of ad auctions in real time. 
• Offering free email storage to over 1.8 billion (active) Gmail users. 
• Zipping (compressing and delivering) billions of YouTube videos to users every day.
