Cloud Security Fundamentals - Chapter 6: Introduction 
The chapter begins by highlighting a significant real-world concern: the security risks associated 
with cloud storage and applications. It cites a 2021 finding by the mobile security 
company Zimperium, which discovered that over 14 percent of mobile apps using cloud 
storage face risks due to unsecured configurations. This problem is not isolated; globally and 
across all industries, various applications are vulnerable. These vulnerabilities can lead to the 
exposure of publicly identifiable information (PII), financial fraud, and the unregulated sharing 
or leakage of internal intellectual property (IP) and sensitive configuration details. 
The primary reason identified for these prevalent risks is often negligence or a lack of 
awareness on the part of developers and organizations. Many entities do not prioritize robust 
security configurations when deploying cloud services. This oversight can lead to unsecured 
setups that inadvertently expose sensitive data like PII. Additional contributing factors can 
include: 
• Time constraints: Rushing applications to market without adequate security reviews. 
• Resource limitations: Lack of budget or skilled personnel dedicated to security. 
• Assumptions: Incorrectly assuming that default cloud settings are secure enough or that 
the cloud provider handles all aspects of security. 
Basic Terms and Concepts in Security: 
1. Confidentiality: 
o Definition: Within cloud environments (and information security in general), 
confidentiality primarily pertains to restricting access to data and ensuring that 
information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. 
o Visual Illustration: An image often depicts this concept. For example, a "cloud 
consumer" (represented by a computer icon) sends a message (envelope icon). If 
there's a breach (suggested by a lightning bolt on the envelope), a question arises: 
"Was this message seen by someone unauthorized?" The message is intended for a 
"cloud provider" (cloud shape) hosting a "cloud service" (yellow circle). This 
highlights the core idea of keeping data private and seen only by authorized parties. 
o Scope in Cloud: Confidentiality in cloud environments extends beyond just data. It 
also includes restricting access to: 
▪ Applications: (e.g., Customer Relationship Management - CRM systems). 
▪ Processes: (e.g., login mechanisms, administrative functions). 

▪ Network resources: (e.g., databases, internal networks). 
2. Integrity: 
o Definition: Integrity refers to the characteristic of data or a system not having been 
altered or tampered with by an unauthorized party. It ensures the accuracy, 
completeness, and trustworthiness of information and systems. 
o Visual Illustration: A similar diagram to the confidentiality one is often used. The 
"cloud consumer" sends a message, but this time the envelope icon has a jagged 
"altered" line through it. The question posed is: "Was this message altered by 
someone unauthorized?" The text further clarifies: "Figure 6.2 The message issued 
by the cloud consumer to the cloud service is considered to have integrity if it has 
not been altered. " This visually represents that integrity is maintained if data remains 
unchanged by unauthorized actions.
