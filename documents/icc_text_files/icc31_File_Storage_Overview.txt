File Storage Overview 
File storage is a solution that presents files to applications and end-users, storing data as elements 
within folders accessible via a hierarchical path through folders and subfolders. It's often associated with 
Network Attached Storage (NAS), enabling users to access and manage files over a network. Examples 
include AWS Elastic File Storage (EFS) and Azure Files. 
Common Uses: 
 Facilitating document collaboration and sharing within organizations. 
 Best for unstructured data like documents, images, videos, and shared files where metadata and 
hierarchical organization are needed. 
Limitations: 
 Efficient with a moderate number of files, but the hierarchical structure can become limiting 
with a large volume of files. 
 Every file has a hierarchical path, and the system must traverse directories to locate files, 
slowing down the lookup process with many files. 
 Scaling is complex due to managing a centralized file system across multiple servers, leading to 
bottlenecks and increased synchronization overhead. 
File Storage Visual and Scenario 
A diagram illustrating file storage includes: 
 Center: An orange rectangle labeled "FILE STORAGE" with "File-sharing space for applications & 
users" below, showing a hierarchical folder structure icon. 
 Left: A box listing examples: EFS (AWS), Azure Files (Microsoft), Filestore (Google Cloud), 
connected by an arrow to the central File Storage. 
 Right: Arrows showing data flowing to/from user icons and server/database icons, indicating 
shared access. 
 Above the diagram: A legend with "+" and "-" symbols indicating: 
o (+ Ideal): Access control & sharing among multiple users & instances, collaboration and 
document sharing, simultaneous access by several instances. 
o (-): Decrease in performance with a large volume of files, complex scaling. 
Scenario: 
 A marketing team of 10 people working on a new product launch needs to share presentations, 
documents, and videos. 
 Instead of emailing files, they use file storage to access a shared folder where everyone can 
upload, edit, and organize files into subfolders like "Images," "Reports," and "Videos." 

 File storage ensures proper file permissions, allowing certain members "read-only" access, while 
others can "edit" the files.
