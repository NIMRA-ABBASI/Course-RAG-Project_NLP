Community Cloud: Definition and Shared Infrastructure 
A Community Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a specific group of 
organizations that share common concerns, such as mission, security requirements, policy, and 
compliance considerations.  
The infrastructure of the community cloud is shared among the participating organizations. This 
shared infrastructure can be managed in several ways: 
• By a third party: An external entity might own and operate the community cloud on behalf 
of the participating organizations. 
• By a combination of one or more organizations in the community: The member 
organizations themselves might jointly own, manage, and govern the cloud infrastructure. 
• Hosted internally or externally: The physical infrastructure might reside on the premises 
of one or more member organizations or be hosted by a third-party provider. 
Logical Boundaries in Community Cloud: 
While resources and infrastructure are shared in a community cloud, each participating 
organization typically maintains its own logical boundaries within this shared environment. This 
means: 
1. Data Segregation: Organizations can keep their data separate and isolated from other 
members of the community. This is often achieved using logical separation techniques 
such as virtualization.  
2. Security Policies: Each organization may implement and enforce its own specific security 
policies, access controls, and governance rules, even though they are utilizing the same 
physical infrastructure as other community members. 
3. Shared Resources, Isolated Applications: While the underlying infrastructure (like 
servers, storage, and networking hardware) is shared among the community members, the 
security measures and logical configurations are often designed to ensure that each 
organization’s data and applications remain isolated from those of others. 
Purpose of a Community Cloud: 
The primary purpose of a community cloud is to provide a shared cloud infrastructure tailored 
to the specific needs of a group of organizations that have similar goals, security requirements, 
compliance mandates, or operational needs. Organizations choose a community cloud for several 
reasons: 

1. Cost Sharing: The costs of building and maintaining the cloud infrastructure can be 
distributed among all member organizations, making it more affordable than each 
organization building its own private cloud. 
2. Common Security and Compliance Needs: If multiple organizations operate under 
similar regulatory, a community cloud can be designed to meet these shared requirements 
efficiently. 
3. Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration and data sharing between organizations that 
have similar missions, research goals, or operational interests. 
4. Customization: A community cloud can be tailored to the specific needs of its members, 
offering more flexibility and specialized features than a generic public cloud, while still 
benefiting from shared resources. 
5. Improved Resource Utilization: Resources are pooled among the community members, 
which can lead to better overall utilization of the infrastructure compared to individual 
private clouds (which might have more idle capacity).
