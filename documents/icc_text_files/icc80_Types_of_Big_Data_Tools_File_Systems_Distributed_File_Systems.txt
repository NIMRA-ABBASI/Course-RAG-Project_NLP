 Two Main Types of Big Data Tools 
When dealing with Big Data, the tools can generally be categorized into two primary types based 
on their core function: 
1. Data Store Tools: 
o Purpose: These tools address the fundamental challenge of how to store and 
access the massive volumes of data. They provide the underlying mechanisms for 
persisting data in a distributed and often fault-tolerant manner. 
o Key Technology: The File System is a critical component here. In the Big Data 
context, this often refers to distributed file systems. 
o Examples: 
▪ Hadoop HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): A cornerstone of the 
Hadoop ecosystem, designed to store very large files across clusters of 
commodity hardware. 
▪ Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): A highly scalable object storage 
service offered by AWS, widely used for data lakes and Big Data storage. 
2. Data Processing Tools: 
o Purpose: Once data is stored, these tools are used to process, analyze, and 
transform it to extract insights, perform computations, or prepare it for other uses. 
o Examples: 
▪ Hadoop MapReduce: A programming model and processing engine within 
the Hadoop framework for parallel processing of large datasets. 
▪ Google Dataflow: A fully managed stream and batch data processing 
service from Google Cloud, also underlying Apache Beam. 
▪ Other examples not explicitly listed but fitting this category include Apache 
Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Storm. 
What is a File System? 
At its core, a File System is a fundamental part of an operating system or storage solution 
that controls how data is stored and retrieved from disk (or other storage media). 
Distributed File Systems 

Distributed File Systems (DFS) are designed to address scenarios where the sheer volume of 
data outgrows the storage capacity of a single machine. Key characteristics and purposes 
include: 
• Addressing Single Machine Limitations: When data becomes too large for one server, a 
DFS is necessary. 
• Data Partitioning: A DFS partitions data across a number of separate machines (nodes 
in a cluster). This allows for storing vastly larger datasets than any single machine could 
handle. 
• Networked Storage Management: DFS solutions manage the storage across a network 
of machines, presenting a unified view of the storage to users and applications, even 
though the data is physically spread out.
