RAID 0 (Striping) - Visual Explanation: 
An image description details a diagram illustrating RAID level 0: 
• Two disk icons are shown, labeled "DISK 1" and "DISK 2" . 
• Each disk is divided into horizontal segments representing data blocks. 
• DISK 1 contains segments labeled A, C, E, G (from top to bottom). 
• DISK 2 contains segments labeled B, D, F , H (from top to bottom). 
This visual demonstrates how data blocks (A through H) are striped (distributed 
sequentially and alternatingly) across the two disks. For example, block A is on Disk 1, 
block B is on Disk 2, block C is back on Disk 1, and so on. This striping allows for parallel 
access, enhancing performance. 
RAID 1 (Mirroring): Details 
RAID 1, commonly known as mirroring, is a RAID configuration focused on data redundancy and 
fault tolerance. 
• Data Distribution: In RAID 1, data is copied identically to two or more disks. Every write 
operation performed on one disk is simultaneously performed on the other disk(s) in the 
mirrored set, creating an exact replica. 
• Performance: 
o Read Performance: Can be good, as read requests can potentially be serviced by 
either disk in the mirrored pair (some controllers can read from both 
simultaneously, improving read speed). 
o Write Performance: Write speed is generally similar to that of a single disk (or 
slightly slower) because data must be written to all disks in the mirror. 
• Fault Tolerance: RAID 1 offers high fault tolerance. Data remains available and the 
system continues to function as long as at least one disk in the mirrored pair is functional. 
If one disk fails, the system can continue operating using the data from the remaining 
healthy disk. The failed disk can then be replaced, and the data from the good disk can be 
copied (rebuilt) onto the new disk to restore the mirror. 
• Minimum Disks: Requires a minimum of two disks. 
Parity: Introduction to the Concept in RAID 

Parity is a method used in some RAID levels (like RAID 3, 4, 5, 6) to provide data redundancy and 
allow for data reconstruction in the event of a single disk failure, without the full storage overhead 
of mirroring (RAID 1). 
• Concept: Parity data is a form of calculated redundancy information. It is essentially a 
type of "hash key" or checksum that is generated from the data blocks stored on the other 
disks within a RAID stripe (a set of corresponding blocks across multiple disks). 
• Generation: Parity information is generated by the RAID controller (either a hardware 
card or software) during write operations. The most common method for calculating parity 
is using an XOR (exclusive OR) operation on the data blocks.
