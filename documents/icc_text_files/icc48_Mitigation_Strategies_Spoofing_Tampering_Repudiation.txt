 Mitigation Strategies (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation) 
This section continues detailing mitigation strategies for threats identified through frameworks like 
STRIDE, focusing on Spoofing, Tampering, and Repudiation. 
1. Spoofing (Identity or Resource Impersonation) - Mitigation Techniques (Continued from 
previous file/page context): 
• Identity Federation: 
o Technique: This approach allows users to authenticate using credentials from a 
trusted third-party identity provider (IdP), such as Google, Microsoft (Azure AD), or 
other enterprise identity systems. The application or service then trusts the 
authentication performed by this external IdP . 
o Benefit: Simplifies user management, allows for single sign-on (SSO) experiences, 
and can leverage the robust security measures of established identity providers, 
making it harder for attackers to spoof identities within the federated system. 
2. Tampering (Data or System Modification) - Mitigation Techniques: 
Tampering involves the unauthorized modification of data, either in transit over a network or at rest 
within a storage system, or the unauthorized modification of system code or configurations. 
• Data Integrity Checks: 
o Technique: Employ mechanisms like hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) or digital 
signatures to ensure that data has not been altered. A hash of the data is computed 
before transmission or storage; upon retrieval, the hash is recomputed and 
compared. If they match, the data's integrity is verified. Digital signatures provide 
both integrity and authenticity. 
• Encryption: 
o Technique: Encrypt data both in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL for network 
communication) and at rest (e.g., encrypting data stored in databases or object 
storage). Encryption makes data unreadable to unauthorized parties, thus 
preventing meaningful tampering. 
• Access Control (Least Privilege): 
o Technique: Implement the principle of least privilege, where users and services are 
granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended 
functions. This minimizes the risk of internal or external attackers with 
compromised accounts being able to tamper with critical data or systems. 

3. Repudiation (Denial of Action or Accountability) - Mitigation Techniques: 
Repudiation occurs when an entity denies having performed an action that they did, in fact, 
perform. Mitigations focus on creating undeniable proof of actions. 
• Comprehensive Logging and Auditing: 
o Technique: Ensure that all significant actions, events, and transactions within the 
system are logged in detail. These logs should be protected from tampering and be 
readily accessible for review and auditing purposes. 
• Immutable Logs: 
o Technique: Use services or techniques that make logs unalterable once written. For 
instance, services like AWS CloudTrail can be configured to deliver logs to an S3 
bucket with write-once, read-many (WORM) characteristics or integrate with log 
management systems that ensure immutability. 
• Audit Trails: 
o Technique: Maintain clear audit trails that ensure the traceability of all actions back 
to a specific, authenticated user or system identity. This provides accountability for 
any changes or operations performed.
