They also made Ma’rib \ntheir capital instead of Sarwah. The ruins of Ma’rib lie at a distance of sixty \nmiles east of San‘a. until 300 A.D. During this period, the tribe of Himyar \nconquered the kingdom of Sheba and took Redan for capital instead of Ma’rib. Later on, Redan was called \"Zifar\". Its ruins still lie on Mudawwar Mountain \nnear the town of \"Yarim\". During this period, they began to decline and fall. Their trade failed to a very great extent, firstly, because of the Nabetean \ndomain over the north of Hijaz; secondly, because of the Roman superiority \nover the naval trade routes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria and the \nnorth of Hijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter-tribal warfare. Thanks to the \nthree above-mentioned factors, families of Qahtan were disunited and \nscattered out. From 300 A.D. until Islam dawned on Yemen. This period witnessed a lot of \ndisorder and turmoil. The great many and civil wars rendered the people of \nYemen liable to foreign subjection and hence loss of independence.

When he saw him, tears filled his eyes and rolled down \nhis cheeks, he embraced him and took him on his camel. The boy, however \nabstained from going with him to Makkah until he took his mother’s consent. Al-Muttalib asked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused. He managed to convince her saying: \"Your son is going to Makkah to restore \nhis father’s authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred House.\" There in \nMakkah, people wondered at seeing Abdul-Muttalib, and they considered him \nthe slave of Muttalib. Al-Muttalib said: \"He is my nephew, the son of my \nbrother Hashim.\" The boy was brought up in Al-Muttalib’s house, but later on \nAl-Muttalib died in Bardman in Yemen so ‘Abdul-Muttalib took over and \nmanaged to maintain his people’s prestige and outdo his grandfathers in his \nhonourable behaviour which gained him Makkah’s deep love and high esteem.

The boy, however \nabstained from going with him to Makkah until he took his mother’s consent. Al-Muttalib asked her to send the boy with him to Makkah, but she refused. He managed to convince her saying: \"Your son is going to Makkah to restore \nhis father’s authority, and to live in the vicinity of the Sacred House.\" There in \nMakkah, people wondered at seeing Abdul-Muttalib, and they considered him \nthe slave of Muttalib. Al-Muttalib said: \"He is my nephew, the son of my \nbrother Hashim.\" The boy was brought up in Al-Muttalib’s house, but later on \nAl-Muttalib died in Bardman in Yemen so ‘Abdul-Muttalib took over and \nmanaged to maintain his people’s prestige and outdo his grandfathers in his \nhonourable behaviour which gained him Makkah’s deep love and high esteem. [Ibn Hisham 1/137,138] \nWhen Al-Muttalib died, Nawfal usurped ‘Abdul-Muttalib of his charges, so the \nlatter asked for help from Quraish but they abstained from extending any sort \nof support to either of them. Consequently, he wrote to his uncles of Bani An-\nNajjar (his mother’s brothers) to come to his aid. His uncle, Abu Sa‘d bin ‘Adi \n(his mother’s brother) marched to Makkah at the head of eighty horsemen \nand camped in Abtah in Makkah. ‘Abdul-Muttalib received the men and invited \nthem to go to his house but Abu Sa‘d said: \"Not before I meet Nawfal.\" He \nfound Nawfal sitting with some old men of Quraish in the shade of Al-Ka‘bah.",

    "text": "He was also the son whom the divination arrows pointed at to \nbe slaughtered as a sacrifice to Al-Ka‘bah. When ‘Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons \nand they reached maturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they \nsilently and obediently acquiesced. Their names were written on divination \narrows and given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The \narrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be \nsacrificed. ‘Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka‘bah with a razor to \nslaughter the boy. Quraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and his brother \nAbu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from consummating his purpose. He then sought their advice as regards his vow. They suggested that he \nsummon a she-diviner to judge whereabout. She ordered that the divination \narrows should be drawn with respect to ‘Abdullah as well as ten camels. She \nadded that drawing the lots should be repeated with ten more camels every \ntime the arrow showed ‘Abdullah. The operation was thus repeated until the \nnumber of the camels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow \nshowed the camels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the \nsatisfaction of Hubal) instead of his son. The slaughtered camels were left for \nanyone to eat from, human or animal. This incident produced a change in the amount of blood-money usually \naccepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was \nincreased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this.

    "enhanced_text": "He was also the son whom the divination arrows pointed at to \nbe slaughtered as a sacrifice to Al-Ka‘bah. When ‘Abdul-Muttalib had ten sons \nand they reached maturity, he divulged to them his secret vow in which they \nsilently and obediently acquiesced. Their names were written on divination \narrows and given to the guardian of their most beloved goddess, Hubal. The \narrows were shuffled and drawn. An arrow showed that it was ‘Abdullah to be \nsacrificed. ‘Abdul-Muttalib then took the boy to Al-Ka‘bah with a razor to \nslaughter the boy. Quraish, his uncles from Makhzum tribe and his brother \nAbu Talib, however, tried to dissuade him from consummating his purpose. He then sought their advice as regards his vow. They suggested that he \nsummon a she-diviner to judge whereabout. She ordered that the divination \narrows should be drawn with respect to ‘Abdullah as well as ten camels. She \nadded that drawing the lots should be repeated with ten more camels every \ntime the arrow showed ‘Abdullah. The operation was thus repeated until the \nnumber of the camels amounted to one hundred. At this point the arrow \nshowed the camels, consequently they were all slaughtered (to the \nsatisfaction of Hubal) instead of his son. The slaughtered camels were left for \nanyone to eat from, human or animal. This incident produced a change in the amount of blood-money usually \naccepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was \nincreased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this. Another thing \nclosely relevant to the above issue goes to the effect that the Prophet [pbuh] \nonce said: \n\"I am the offspring of the slaughtered two,\" meaning Ishmael and ‘Abdullah.

To say that it lasted for three and a half years, as some scholars allege, is \nnot correct, but here there is no room to go into more details. Meanwhile, the Prophet [pbuh], was caught in a sort of depression coupled with \nastonishment and perplexity.

The verses meant to extract him forcibly out of his sleep, divest \nhim of his mantle and detach him from the warmth and quiet of life, and then drive \nhim down a new course attended with countless hardships, and requiring a great \ndeal of strife in the way of All? 48\n\"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! [Al-\nQur'an 74:1-2] \nSuggesting that to live to oneself is quite easy, but it has been decided that you \nhave to shoulder this heavy burden; consequently sleep, comfort, or warm bed are \nitems decreed to be alien in your lexicon of life. O Muhammad, arise quickly for the \nstrife and toil awaiting you; no time is there for sleep and such amenities; grave \nresponsibilities have been Divinely determined to fall to your lot, and drive you into \nthe turmoil of life to develop a new sort of precarious affinity with the conscience of \npeople and the reality of life. The Prophet [pbuh] managed quite successfully to rise to his feet and measure up to \nthe new task, he went ahead in a spirit of complete selflessness, relentlessly striving \nand never abating in carrying the burden of the great Trust, the burden of \nenlightening mankind, and the heavy weight of the new faith and strife for over \ntwenty years, nothing distracting his attention from the awesome commission. reward him, for us and all humanity, the best ending. The following research at \nhand gives an account in miniature of his long strive and uninterrupted struggle he \nmade after receiving the ministry of Messengership.

This Chapter in fact narrates the different stages that Moses [AWS] passed through \nin his struggle with Pharaoh and the mission of calling his people unto All? Moreover, it includes stories that speak about the terrible end in store for those who \nbelied the Messengers such as the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, Abraham, Lout and \nAhlul-Aikah (Companions of the Wood).

Another \npoint you have got to bear in mind is that your relatives are sufficient unto you.

    "text": "utdo \nMuhammad [pbuh]. [Ibn Hisham 1/299,300,358; Tafheem-ul-Qur'an 4/8,9]. Ibn ‘Abbas [R] related that An-Nadr used to purchase songstresses who would \nthrough their bodily charms and songs entice away from Islam anyone \ndeveloping the least attachment to the Prophet [pbuh]; in this regard, All? says: \n\"And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to \nmislead (men) from the Path of All? [Al-Qur'an 31:6] [Tafheem-ul-Qur'an \n4/9] \n4.

Ja‘far recited the opening verses of S? ah Maryam \n(Chapter 19 — Mary) wherein is told the story of the birth of both John and Jesus \nChrist, down to the account of Mary having been fed with the food miraculously. Thereupon the king, along with the bishops of his realm, was moved to tears that \nrolled down his cheeks and even wet his beard. Here, the Negus exclaimed: \"It \nseems as if these words and those which were revealed to Jesus are the rays of the \nlight which have radiated from the same source.\" Turning to the crest-fallen envoys \nof Quraish, he said, \"I am afraid, I cannot give you back these refugees.

Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah addressing him said: \"Abu Talib, would you \nabandon the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib?\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] constantly \nrequested him (to accept his offer), and (on the other hand) was repeated the same \nstatement (of Abu Jahl and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Omaiyah) — till Abu Talib gave his final \ndecision and he stuck to the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib and refused to profess that \nthere is no true god but Allâh. Upon this the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: \n\"By Allâh, I will persistently beg pardon for you till I am forbidden to do so \n(by Allâh)\". It was then that Allâh, the Magnificent and Glorious revealed this verse: \n\"It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s \nforgiveness for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers \nin the Oneness of Allâh) even though they be of kin, after it has become \nclear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a \nstate of disbelief).\" [Al-Qur'an 9:113] \nAnd it was said to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]: \n\"Verily! You (O Muhammad [pbuh]) guide not whom you like.\" [Al-Qur'an \n28:56] [Bukhari 1/548] \nIt goes without saying that Abu Talib was very much attached to Muhammad [pbuh] \n.",

He called on Bani Haneefah in their habitation, but received very repugnant \ntreatment. He addressed Bani ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘ah in their encampment, calling them to \nabandon idolatry and join him. One of them called Buhairah bin Firras, \nanswered him back: \"Should we give you allegiance and Allâh give you power \nover your opponents, will you give us right to inheritance and succeed you in \npower?\" The Prophet replied: \"The whole affair lies in Allâh’s Hands.

Hardly did the evening of that \nday arrive when all the men and women of that sept of Arabians embraced Islam \nwith the exception of one, Al-Usairim, who hung back until the Day of Uhud. On that \nday he embraced Islam and fought the polytheists but was eventually killed before \nobserving any prostration in the way of prayer. The Prophet [pbuh] commented \nsaying: \"He has done a little but his reward is great.\" Mus‘ab stayed in Madinah carrying out his mission diligently and successfully until all \nthe houses of Al-Ansar (the future Helpers) had Muslims elements, men and women. One family only stood obdurate to the Islamic Da‘wah (Call). They were under the \ninfluence of the poet Qais bin Al-Aslat, who managed to hold them at bay and screen \noff the Call of Islam from their ears until the year 5 A.H. Shortly before the approach of the following pilgrimage season, i.e. the thirteenth \nyear of Prophethood, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair returned to Makkah carrying to the Prophe",

Around \nthe camel of Muhammad [pbuh] and his immediate followers, rode the chiefs of the \ncity in their best raiment and in glittering armour, everyone saying: \"Alight here O \nMessenger of Allâh, abide by us.\" Muhammad [pbuh] used to answer everyone \ncourteously and kindly: \"This camel is commanded by Allâh, wherever it stops, that \nwill be my abode.\" The camel moved onward with slackened rein, reached the site of the Prophetic \nMosque and knelt down. He did not dismount until it rose up again, went on forward, \nturned back and then returned to kneel down in the very former spot. Here, he \nalighted in a quarter inhabited by Banu Najjar, a tribe related to the Prophet [pbuh] \nfrom the maternal side. In fact, it was his wish to honour his maternal uncles and \nlive among them.",

The Prophet wanted to \nimpress upon the polytheists and Jews of Madinah as well as the bedouins in its \nvicinity, that the Muslims had smashed their old fears, and had been too strong to be \nattacked with impunity. He also wanted to display the power of his followers in order \nto deter Quraish from committing any military folly against him which might 127\njeopardize their economic life and means of living, and to stop them from \npersecuting the helpless Muslims detained in Makkah, consequently he would avail \nhimself of this opportunity and resume his job of propagating the Divine Call freely. The following is a resume of these missions and errands: \n1. Saif Al-Bahr Platoon sent in Ramadan 1 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. led by Hamzah bin \n‘Abdul Muttalib and comprising 30 Emigrants with a definite task of \nintercepting a caravan belonging to Quraish. It was a caravan of 300 people \nincluding Abu Jahl bin Hisham. The two parties encountered each other and \naligned in preparation for fighting. Majdi bin ‘Amr, on good terms with both \nsides, happened to be there and managed to prevent an imminent clash. On that occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] accredited the first flag in the history of \nMuslims. It was white in colour and was entrusted to Kinaz bin Husain Al-\nGhanawi, to carry. In Shawwal, 1 A.H., i.e. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \ndespatched ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib at the head of 60 horsemen \nof Emigrants to a spot called Batn Rabegh where they encountered Abu \nSufyan at the head of a caravan of 200 men. There was arrow shooting but \nno actual fighting. It is interesting to note that two Muslims, Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr Al-Bahrani and \n‘Utbah bin Ghazwan Al-Mazini, defected from the caravan of Quraish and \njoined the ranks of ‘Ubaidah.",

He also wanted to display the power of his followers in order \nto deter Quraish from committing any military folly against him which might 127\njeopardize their economic life and means of living, and to stop them from \npersecuting the helpless Muslims detained in Makkah, consequently he would avail \nhimself of this opportunity and resume his job of propagating the Divine Call freely. The following is a resume of these missions and errands: \n1. Saif Al-Bahr Platoon sent in Ramadan 1 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. led by Hamzah bin \n‘Abdul Muttalib and comprising 30 Emigrants with a definite task of \nintercepting a caravan belonging to Quraish. It was a caravan of 300 people \nincluding Abu Jahl bin Hisham. The two parties encountered each other and \naligned in preparation for fighting. Majdi bin ‘Amr, on good terms with both \nsides, happened to be there and managed to prevent an imminent clash. On that occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] accredited the first flag in the history of \nMuslims. It was white in colour and was entrusted to Kinaz bin Husain Al-\nGhanawi, to carry. In Shawwal, 1 A.H., i.e. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] \ndespatched ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib at the head of 60 horsemen \nof Emigrants to a spot called Batn Rabegh where they encountered Abu \nSufyan at the head of a caravan of 200 men. There was arrow shooting but \nno actual fighting. It is interesting to note that two Muslims, Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr Al-Bahrani and \n‘Utbah bin Ghazwan Al-Mazini, defected from the caravan of Quraish and \njoined the ranks of ‘Ubaidah.",

By this manoeuvre, \nhe was able to slip past the Madinese ambush and was out of their reach. On receiving Abu Sufyan’s message, the Makkan army showed a desire to return \nhome. The tyrant Abu Jahl, however haughtily and arrogantly insisted that they \nproceed to Badr, stay three nights there for making festivities. Now they wanted to \npunish the Muslims and prevent them from intercepting their caravans, and impress \non the Arabs that Quraish still had the upper hand and enjoyed supremacy in that \narea. Abu Jahl’s threats and insistence notwithstanding, Banu Zahrah, acting on the advice \nof Al-Akhnas bin Shuraiq, broke away and returned to Makkah.

He ran \noff and plunged into the sea. The ranks of Quraish began to give way and their numbers added nothing but \nconfusion.

Abu Jahl was deserted and left by himself on \nhis horse waiting for death at the hand of two courageous lads of the Helpers. ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf related the following interesting story in this regard: I was \nin the thick of the battle when two youths, still seemingly inexperienced in the art of 140\nfighting, one on the right and the second on the left.

The Prophet [pbuh] \nassured Usaid that he had believed him. The Prophet [pbuh] now entered Madinah as a man to be counted for in a new \ndimension — the military field. In consequence, a large number of the people of \nMadinah embraced Islam, which added a lot to the strength, power and moral \nstanding of the true religion. The Prophet [pbuh] exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an \nextent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part \nof the meal) and keep the dates for themselves. Prisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new \nphenomenon in the history of Islam. The Prophet [pbuh] consulted Abu Bakr and \n‘Umar bin Al-Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr \nsuggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: \"They are after all \nour relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers, \nmoreover, Allâh could guide them to Islam.\" ‘Umar advised killing them, saying, \n\"They are the leaders of Kufr (disbelief).\" The Prophet [pbuh] preferred Abu Bakr’s \nsuggestion to that of ‘Umar’s. The following day, ‘Umar called on the Prophet [pbuh] \nand Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired \nabout the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he \nwould feign weeping. The Prophet [pbuh] said that a Qur’ânic verse had been revealed rebuking them for \ntaking ransom from the captives rather than slaying them: \n\"It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them \nwith ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in \nthe land.

At Ar-Rawhâ’, a suburb of Madinah, the Muslim army was received by the joyous \nMadinese who had come to congratulate the Prophet [pbuh] on the manifest victory \nthat Allâh had granted him. Usaid bin Hudair, acting as a mouthpiece of the other \ntrue believers, after entertaining Allâh’s praise, he excused himself for not having \njoined them on grounds that the Prophet [pbuh]’s intention was presumably, an \nerrand aiming to intercept a caravan of camels only, he added that if it had occurred \nto him that it would be real war, he would have never tarried. The Prophet [pbuh] \nassured Usaid that he had believed him. The Prophet [pbuh] now entered Madinah as a man to be counted for in a new \ndimension — the military field. In consequence, a large number of the people of \nMadinah embraced Islam, which added a lot to the strength, power and moral \nstanding of the true religion.

Then he said: \"Allow me to do so(once again).\" He then held his head fast and said \nto his companions: \"Do your job.\" The group of men came back \nafter fulfilling their mission. One of them Al-Harith bin Aws was wounded by mistake \nwith the swords of his men, and was bleeding badly. When they reached Baqee‘ Al-\nGharqad, they shouted, \"Allâh is Great\". The Prophet [pbuh] heard them and realized \nthat they had killed the enemy of Allâh. As they saw him, he said: \"Cheerful faces \nare yours.\" In reply, they said: \"And yours O Messenger of Allâh.\" They handed the \nhead of the tyrant over to him. He entertained Allâh’s praise for their success.",

Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] held a head military consultation assembly to \nexchange views about the situation. He told them about a dream he had. He said: \n\"By Allâh, I have dreamt of — I implore Allâh to be a dream of bounty — cows \nslaughtered and that there was a groove at the pointed top of my sword, and that I \nhad inserted my hand into an immune armour.\" The interpretation of ‘the cows’ was that some of his men were killed, and ‘the \ngroove at the pointed top of his sword’ was that a member of his House would be \nhurt. As for ‘the armour’ it was Madinah. Then he offered a suggestion that his \nCompanions should not go out of Madinah and that they should encamp themselves \nwithin the city. He was of the opinion that the enemies should be left in the open to \nexhaust themselves and thus the Muslims would not risk a battle. But if they thought \nof attacking Madinah, Muslim men would be ready to fight them at the mouths of \nlanes; whereas Muslim-women would help from over the house roofs.\" ‘Abdullah bin \nUbai bin Salul — the head of the hypocrites; who attended the meeting as a chief of \nAl-Khazraj — supported the Prophet [pbuh]’s plan. As a matter of fact his agreement was not based on the righteousness of the plan \nbut rather on personal benefit. He did not want to fight. On the contrary he secretly \naimed at being far away from fight. However it was Allâh’s Will that he should be \ndisclosed and disgraced in public — for the first time. It was His Will that the curtain \nwhich concealed their disbelief behind should be uncovered and pulled down. Allâh’s \nWill enabled the Muslims to recognize the reality of those snakes that were creeping \nwithin their garments and inside the sleeves of their clothes. Thanks to Allâh they \nrecognized them in one of the most critical times of their lives. 157\nSome of the best honourable Companions, who had missed Al-Jihâd in Badr invasion, \nsuggested that the Prophet [pbuh] should go out of Madinah and urged him to \naccept their point of view.",

[Fath Al-Bari 7/346] \nWar activities went on and on fierecly with the Muslims in full command of the whole \nmilitary developments until the idolaters finally staggered and retreated, leaving all \nmotives of alleged pride, and affected dignity in oblivion, and their standard trodden \nby the feet of the fighters with none ever courageous enough to approach it. It \nseemed as if the three thousand idolaters had been fighting thirty thousand Muslims \nand not merely several hundreds. 167\nIbn Ishaq said: \"Then Allâh sent down His Help unto the Muslims and verified His \nPromise to them. They chased the idolaters and evacuated them from their camp. No \ndoubt it was a certain defeat.\" In a version by ‘Abdullah bin Az-Zubair that his father \nhad said: \"By Allâh, I was watching the servants of Hind bint ‘Utbah and her women \nfriends fleeing with their garments gathered up. No one was there to prevent us from \ncapturing them. \"[Ibn Hisham 2/77] \nIn another version by Al-Barâ’ bin ‘Azib — mentioned in Sahih Al-Bukhâri — he said: \n\"When we fought them, they fled, and their women could be seen fleeing in the \nmountains with their anklets and legs revealed. \"[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/579] The Muslims \npursued the enemies putting them to sword and collecting the spoils. The Archers’ Fatal Mistake \nWhile the small army of Islam were recording the second absolute and clear victory \nover the Makkans — which was no less in splendour and glory than the first one at \nBadr — the majority of the archers on the mountainside committed a fatal mistake \nthat turned the whole situation upside down, and constituted a source of heavy \nlosses amongst the Muslims.",

Hatib bin Balta‘a followed ‘Utbah bin Abi Waqqas — who \nbroke the honourable incisor (of the Prophet [pbuh]) — struck him with the sword, \ncracked his head and took his mare and sword. Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas was so keen to \nkill his brother ‘Utbah, but he could not; however, Hatib could. Sahl bin Haneef — a hero archer — who had pledged to die in the cause of Allâh, \nalso played a prominent part in Uhud hostilities. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself was involved in shooting arrows. In a version \nby Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] shot so many arrows \nthat the two ends of his bow were flattened. So Qatadah bin An-Nu‘man took it to \nremain with him for good. On that day his eye was so hurt that it fell down onto his \ncheek; but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] reput it in its socket with his hand and it \nbecame the better and the more sharp-sighted of the two. On that day ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf kept on fighting till his mouth was hurt and got \nbroken. He sustained over twenty wounds, some in his leg, and that lamed him. Malik bin Sinan, the father of Abi Sa‘eed Al-Khudri sucked the blood out of the \nProphet [pbuh]’s cheek till he cleaned it. The Prophet [pbuh] said: \"Spit it!\".",

[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/97] \nThe Muslims showed unprecedented rare heroism and marvellous sacrifices. Abu \nTalha — for instance — shielded the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] by his body and used \nhis chest to protect him against the enemy arrows. Anas related that on Uhud Day \nwhen people dispersed off the Prophet [pbuh], Abu Talhah was a skillful sort of \narcher who would pull arrows so much that he broke two or three bows that day. When a man passed along with a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet [pbuh] would \nsay: \"Spread the arrows to Abu Talhah!\" Then when the Prophet [pbuh] watched 173\npeople shooting, Abu Talhah would say: \"I sacrifice my father and mother for your \nsafety.

The Companions of the Prophet [pbuh], who \nwere encompassed by idolaters, kept on fighting till they were all killed. 189\nsurvivor was Ka‘b bin Zaid bin An-Najjar who was carried wounded from among the \ndead. It was in Al-Khandaq (the trench) Battle that he was killed. ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari and Al-Mundhir bin ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir, who were \nentrusted with the Muslims’ animals far from them, saw the birds circling in the air \nover the battleground. Al-Mundhir rushed to share in the fight till he was killed. But \n‘Amr bin Omaiyah was captured. ‘Amir set him free when he knew that he was of \nMudar tribe but that was after he had cut his hair. He did that to fulfil a pledge of his \nmother’s to set a slave free. Returning to the Prophet [pbuh] ‘Amr bin Omaiyah conveyed the news of the painful \ndisaster, which resulted in the murder of seventy of the best believers, and recalled \nthe tragedy of Uhud but with the difference that those of Uhud were killed in a clear \nwar but those of Ma‘una were killed in a disgraceful treachery. On his way back to \nQarqara, ‘Amr bin Omaiyah rested in the shade of a tree, and there two men of Bani \nKilab joined him. When they slept, ‘Amr killed them both, thinking that by doing that \nhe would avenge some of his killed companions. Then he found out that they had \nbeen given a pledge of protection by the Prophet [pbuh]. He told the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] what he had done. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to ‘Amr: \"You \nhave killed two people; their blood-money shall be a debt I have to discharge.\" He \nthen engaged himself collecting their blood-money from the Muslims and their allies, \nthe Jews [Ibn Hisham 2/183-188; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/109-110; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/584-\n586]. This very act was later to trigger the invasion of Bani An-Nadeer. The Prophet [pbuh] was so deeply moved by this tragedy and that of Ar-Raji‘ that he \nused to invoke Allâh’s wrath against those people and tribes who killed his \nCompanions.",

Returning to the Prophet [pbuh] ‘Amr bin Omaiyah conveyed the news of the painful \ndisaster, which resulted in the murder of seventy of the best believers, and recalled \nthe tragedy of Uhud but with the difference that those of Uhud were killed in a clear \nwar but those of Ma‘una were killed in a disgraceful treachery. On his way back to \nQarqara, ‘Amr bin Omaiyah rested in the shade of a tree, and there two men of Bani \nKilab joined him. When they slept, ‘Amr killed them both, thinking that by doing that \nhe would avenge some of his killed companions. Then he found out that they had \nbeen given a pledge of protection by the Prophet [pbuh]. He told the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] what he had done. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to ‘Amr: \"You \nhave killed two people; their blood-money shall be a debt I have to discharge.\" He \nthen engaged himself collecting their blood-money from the Muslims and their allies, \nthe Jews [Ibn Hisham 2/183-188; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/109-110; Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/584-\n586]. This very act was later to trigger the invasion of Bani An-Nadeer. The Prophet [pbuh] was so deeply moved by this tragedy and that of Ar-Raji‘ that he \nused to invoke Allâh’s wrath against those people and tribes who killed his \nCompanions.",

To tell the truth, if they had launched a surprise \nattack against Madinah, they could have exterminated all the Muslims. However, the \nleadership inside the city was on the alert and the intelligence personnel managed to \nreconnoitre the area of the enemies, and reported their movement to the people in \ncharge in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned a high advisory board \nand conducted a careful discussion of a plan to defend Madinah. After a lengthy talk \nbetween military leaders and people possessed of sound advice, it was agreed, on \nthe proposal of an honourable Companion, Salman Al-Farisi, to dig trenches as \ndefensive lines. The Muslims, with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head, encouraging, \nhelping and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, most actively and \ndiligently started to build a trench around Madinah. Severe hunger, bordering on \nstarvation, could not dissuade or discourage them from achieving their desperately \nsought objective. Salman said: O Messenger of Allâh! When siege was to laid to us in \nPersia, we used to dig trenches to defend ourselves. It was really an unprecedented \nwise plan. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] hurriedly gave orders to implement the \nplan. Forty yards was allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa‘d said: We \nwere in the company of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], the men used to dig and we \nevacuate the earth on our backs. Some preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. Jabir bin \n‘Abdullah, seeing the Prophet [pbuh] starving, slaughtered a sheep, cooked some \nbarley and requested the Prophet [pbuh] and some Companions to accept his \ninvitation, but the Prophet [pbuh] gathered all the thousand people engaged in \ndigging the trench and they started to eat until they were all completely full and yet \nthe shoulder of mutton and dough that was being baked remained as they were \nundiminished. A certain woman brought a handful of dates and passed by the \nProphet [pbuh], who took the dates, threw them over his cloak and invited his 196\nfollowers to eat.

    "enhanced_text": "It was a great \narmy of ten thousand fighters. They in fact outnumbered all the Muslims in Madinah, \nwomen, lads and elders included. To tell the truth, if they had launched a surprise \nattack against Madinah, they could have exterminated all the Muslims. However, the \nleadership inside the city was on the alert and the intelligence personnel managed to \nreconnoitre the area of the enemies, and reported their movement to the people in \ncharge in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned a high advisory board \nand conducted a careful discussion of a plan to defend Madinah. After a lengthy talk \nbetween military leaders and people possessed of sound advice, it was agreed, on \nthe proposal of an honourable Companion, Salman Al-Farisi, to dig trenches as \ndefensive lines. The Muslims, with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head, encouraging, \nhelping and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, most actively and \ndiligently started to build a trench around Madinah. Severe hunger, bordering on \nstarvation, could not dissuade or discourage them from achieving their desperately \nsought objective. Salman said: O Messenger of Allâh! When siege was to laid to us in \nPersia, we used to dig trenches to defend ourselves. It was really an unprecedented \nwise plan. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] hurriedly gave orders to implement the \nplan. Forty yards was allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa‘d said: We \nwere in the company of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], the men used to dig and we \nevacuate the earth on our backs. Some preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. Jabir bin \n‘Abdullah, seeing the Prophet [pbuh] starving, slaughtered a sheep, cooked some \nbarley and requested the Prophet [pbuh] and some Companions to accept his \ninvitation, but the Prophet [pbuh] gathered all the thousand people engaged in \ndigging the trench and they started to eat until they were all completely full and yet \nthe shoulder of mutton and dough that was being baked remained as they were \nundiminished. A certain woman brought a handful of dates and passed by the \nProphet [pbuh], who took the dates, threw them over his cloak and invited his 196\nfollowers to eat. The dates began to increase in number until they dropped over the \ntrim of his robe. Another illustrious preternatural example went to the effect that an \nobstinate rock stood out as an immune obstacle in the ditch. The Prophet [pbuh] \ntook the spade and struck, and the rock immediately turned into a loose sand dune.

Gabriel noted that he with a \nprocession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their \nhearts. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], immediately summoned the prayer caller and \nordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm \nMaktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib \nwho marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews \nabusing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who on his part set out at the head of three \nthousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajireen \n(Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others \noffered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet [pbuh] objected to neither. When \nthey reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. Seeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka‘b bin Asad offered \nthem three alternatives: to embrace Islam, and consequently their life, wealth, \nwomen and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such \nbehaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about \nthe veracity of Muhammad’s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then \nchallenge the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers to the sword to either exterminate \nthe Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad [pbuh] \nand his people by surprise on Saturday — a day mutually understood to witness no \nfighting.

Gabriel noted that he with a \nprocession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their \nhearts. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], immediately summoned the prayer caller and \nordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm \nMaktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib \nwho marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews \nabusing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who on his part set out at the head of three \nthousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajireen \n(Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others \noffered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet [pbuh] objected to neither. When \nthey reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. Seeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka‘b bin Asad offered \nthem three alternatives: to embrace Islam, and consequently their life, wealth, \nwomen and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such \nbehaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about \nthe veracity of Muhammad’s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then \nchallenge the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers to the sword to either exterminate \nthe Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad [pbuh] \nand his people by surprise on Saturday — a day mutually understood to witness no \nfighting. None of those alternatives appealed them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly, \nturned to them saying: \"You have never been decisive in decision-making since you \nwere born\" The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some \nMuslims, who had maintained good relation with them, in order to learn about their \nfate in the light of the current circumstances.",

The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not \nlikely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims turned \nout to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think that they would \nbecome apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this truce assumed its full \ndimensions in some subsequent events. After the Prophet [pbuh] had reached \nMadinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped from Quraish, came to him as a Muslim; \nQuraish sent two men demanding his return, so the Prophet [pbuh] handed him over \nto them. On the way to Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the \nother one fled to Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet \n[pbuh], he said, \"Your obligation is over and Allâh has freed you from it. You duly \nhanded me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them.\" The Prophet \n[pbuh] said, \"Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been \nothers with him.\" When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to \nthem, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims \nwho were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by \nAbu Jandal and others until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge \non Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah finding \nthemselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet [pbuh] to do \naway with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh \nand by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the \nMuslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet [pbuh] sent for the \ngroup and they responded, as expected, positively. These are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all \nfunction in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty \nmade it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not given access to the Holy \nSanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation \nwith the pagans of Quraish. ‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking \nfull grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet [pbuh] and said: \"Aren’t you the true \nMessenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied calmly, \"Why not?\"",

The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not \nlikely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims turned \nout to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think that they would \nbecome apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this truce assumed its full \ndimensions in some subsequent events. After the Prophet [pbuh] had reached \nMadinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped from Quraish, came to him as a Muslim; \nQuraish sent two men demanding his return, so the Prophet [pbuh] handed him over \nto them. On the way to Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the \nother one fled to Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet \n[pbuh], he said, \"Your obligation is over and Allâh has freed you from it. You duly \nhanded me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them.\" The Prophet \n[pbuh] said, \"Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been \nothers with him.\" When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to \nthem, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims \nwho were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by \nAbu Jandal and others until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge \non Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. The pagans of Makkah finding \nthemselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet [pbuh] to do \naway with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh \nand by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the \nMuslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet [pbuh] sent for the \ngroup and they responded, as expected, positively. These are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all \nfunction in favour of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty \nmade it distasteful to some Muslims, namely they were not given access to the Holy \nSanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation \nwith the pagans of Quraish. ‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking \nfull grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet [pbuh] and said: \"Aren’t you the true \nMessenger of Allâh?\" The Prophet [pbuh] replied calmly, \"Why not?\"",

So if he tells a lie, they should contradict him \n(instantly)’. By Allâh had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a \nliar, I would have told lies\", Abu Sufyan later said. Abu Sufyan’s testimony went as follows: \"Muhammad descends from a noble family. No one of his family happened to assume kingship. His followers are those deemed \nweak with numbers ever growing. He neither tells lies nor betrays others, we fight \nhim and he fights us but with alternate victory. He bids people to worship Allâh Alone \nwith no associate, and abandon our fathers’ beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer, \nhonesty, abstinence and maintain strong family ties.\" \"Hercules, on hearing this \ntestimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his following \nimpression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of Muhammad’s \nProphethood: ‘I fully realize that Prophets come from noble families; he does not \naffect any previous example of Prophethood. Since none of his ancestors was a \nmonarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s \nmonarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to people, he is for the more reason, \nimmune to telling lies as regards Allâh.

    "enhanced_text": "Hercules, seated amongst his chiefs of \nstaff, asked, \"Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a \nProphet?\" \"I (Abu Sufyan) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst \nthe group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind \nme. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). Abu \nSufyan’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that \nmen who claims to be a Prophet. So if he tells a lie, they should contradict him \n(instantly)’. By Allâh had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a \nliar, I would have told lies\", Abu Sufyan later said. Abu Sufyan’s testimony went as follows: \"Muhammad descends from a noble family. No one of his family happened to assume kingship. His followers are those deemed \nweak with numbers ever growing. He neither tells lies nor betrays others, we fight \nhim and he fights us but with alternate victory. He bids people to worship Allâh Alone \nwith no associate, and abandon our fathers’ beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer, \nhonesty, abstinence and maintain strong family ties.\" \"Hercules, on hearing this \ntestimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his following \nimpression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of Muhammad’s \nProphethood: ‘I fully realize that Prophets come from noble families; he does not \naffect any previous example of Prophethood. Since none of his ancestors was a \nmonarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s \nmonarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to people, he is for the more reason, \nimmune to telling lies as regards Allâh. Concerning his followers being those deemed \nweak with numbers ever growing, it is something that goes in agreement with \nquestions of Faith until this latter assumes its full dimensions geographically and \ndemographically.

By the way, the latter did also enter into the fold \nof Islam. ‘Abd: What was his people’s reaction? ‘Amr: They approved of him and followed his steps. ‘Abd: The bishops and monks? ‘Amr: They did the same. ‘Abd: Beware ‘Amr of lying for this soon betrays man. ‘Amr: I never tell lies; moreover, our religion never allows it. ‘Abd: Has Hercules been informed of the Islamization of Negus? 229\n‘Amr: Yes, of course. ‘Abd: How did you happen to know that?",

The same events recurred; the Muslims besieged the new site for three days \nand then the great Muslim hero Abu Dujanah Sammak bin Kharshah Al-Ansari — of \nthe red ribbon — led the Muslim army and broke into the castle, conducted fierce \nmilitary operations within and forced the remaining Jews to flee for their lives into \nanother fort, An-Nizar. An-Nizar was the most powerful fort, and the Jews came to the established \nconviction that it was too immune to be stormed, so they deemed it a safe place for \ntheir children and women. The Muslims, however, were not dismayed but dragged on \nthe siege, but because standing at a commanding top, the fort was impregnable. The \nJews inside were too cowardly to meet the Muslims in open fight but rather hurled a \nshower of arrows and stones on the attackers. Considering this situation, the Prophet \n[pbuh] ordered that rams be used and these proved effective and caused cracks in \nthe ramparts providing an easy access into the heart of the fort, where the Jews \nwere put to rout and fled in all directions leaving behind their women and children.",

Unlike the Jews of Khaibar and people of Makkah, they had a liking for living in the \nwilderness dispersed in scattered spots, hence the difficulty of bringing them under \ncontrol, and the futility of carrying out deterrent campaigns against them. However, \nthe Prophet [pbuh] was determined to put an end to this unacceptable situation and \ncalled the Muslims around him to get ready to launch a decisive campaign against \nthose harassing rebels. Meanwhile it was reported to him that Bani Muharib and \nBanu Tha‘lbah of the Ghatfan tribe were gathering army in order to encounter the \nMuslims. The Prophet [pbuh] proceeded towards Najd at the head of 400 or 700 \nmen, after he had mandated Abu Dhar - in another version, ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan - to \ndispose the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The Muslim fighters penetrated \ndeep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhlah where they came across \nsome bedouins of Ghatfan, but no fighting took place because the latter had agreed \nto go into reconciliation with the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] led his followers that \nday in a prayer of fear. Al-Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari, narrated that they set out on an \nexpedition with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. \"We were six in number and had \n(with us) only one camel which we rode turn by turn. Our feet were injured. My feet \nwere so badly injured that my nails came off. We, therefore, bandaged our feet with \nrags, so this expedition was called Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ (i.e. the expedition of rags.)\" [Sahih Al-\nBukhari 2/592; Sahih Muslim 2/118] \nJabir narrated: In the course of Dhat-ur-Riqa‘ expedition, we came to a leafy tree \nwhere the Prophet [pbuh] sat shading himself off the burning sun.

The Muslims performed the usual circumambulation \nvigorously and briskly; and on recommendation by the Prophet [pbuh] they did their \nbest to appear strong and steadfast in their circumambulation as the polytheists had \nspread rumours that they were weak because the fever of Yathrib (Madinah) had \nsapped their strength. They were ordered to run in the first three rounds and then \nwalk in the remaining ones. The Makkans meanwhile aligned on the top of Qu‘aiqa‘an \nMount watching the Muslims, tongue-tied at witnessing their strength and devotion. When they entered the Holy Sanctuary, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha walked before the \nProphet [pbuh] reciting: \n\"Get out of his way, you disbelievers, make way, we will fight you about its \nrevelation with strokes that will remove heads from shoulders and make friend \nunmindful of friend.\"",

    "text": "245\nThe Battle of Mu’tah \nIt was the most significant and the fiercest battle during the lifetime of the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], a preliminary and a prelude to the great conquests of the \nland of the Christians. It took place in Jumada Al-Ula 8 A.H. / September 629 A.D. \nMu’tah is a village that lies on the borders of geographical Syria. The Prophet [pbuh] had sent Al-Harith bin ‘Umair Al-Azdi on an errand to carry a \nletter to the ruler of Busra. On his way, he was intercepted by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr \nAl-Ghassani, the governor of Al-Balqa’ and a close ally to Caesar, the Byzantine \nEmperor. Al-Harith was tied and beheaded by Al-Ghassani. Killing envoys and messengers used to be regarded as the most awful crime, and \namounted to the degree of war declaration.

    "enhanced_text": "245\nThe Battle of Mu’tah \nIt was the most significant and the fiercest battle during the lifetime of the \nMessenger of Allâh [pbuh], a preliminary and a prelude to the great conquests of the \nland of the Christians. It took place in Jumada Al-Ula 8 A.H. / September 629 A.D. \nMu’tah is a village that lies on the borders of geographical Syria. The Prophet [pbuh] had sent Al-Harith bin ‘Umair Al-Azdi on an errand to carry a \nletter to the ruler of Busra. On his way, he was intercepted by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr \nAl-Ghassani, the governor of Al-Balqa’ and a close ally to Caesar, the Byzantine \nEmperor. Al-Harith was tied and beheaded by Al-Ghassani. Killing envoys and messengers used to be regarded as the most awful crime, and \namounted to the degree of war declaration. The Prophet [pbuh] was shocked on \nhearing the news and ordered that a large army of 3000 men be mobilized and \ndespatched to the north to discipline the transgressors.

He thereby rescued the \nSacred House, whose guidance all people seek. It was the greatest propitious event \nin heaven and on earth. It was the most significant prelude to a new era that was to \nwitness the great march of Islamization and the entry of people into the fold of Islam \nin huge hosts. It provided an ever shining face and a most glowing source of \ninspiration to the whole earth. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/160] \nPre-Conquest Events \nAccording to the terms of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Arab tribes were given the \noption to join either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraish, with which they desired \nto enter into treaty alliance. Should any of these tribes suffer aggression, then the \nparty to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu \nBakr joined Quraish, and Khuza‘ah joined the Prophet [pbuh]. They thus lived in \npeace for sometime but ulterior motives stretching back to pre-Islamic period ignited \nby unabated fire of revenge triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without caring a \nbit for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza‘ah in a place called Al-\nWateer in Sha‘ban, 8 A.H. Quraish helped Banu Bakr with men and arms taking \nadvantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah \nsought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary \nto all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chasing them in the \nsanctified area — where no blood should be shed — massacred his adversaries. When the aggrieved party sought justice from their Muslim allies, the Prophet \n[pbuh], as their leader, demanded an immediate redress for not only violating the \ntreaty but also slaying men allied to him in the sanctified area. Three demands were \nmade, the acceptance of any one of them was imperative: \na. to pay blood money for the victims of Khuza‘ah, \nb. to terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr; or \nc. to consider the truce to have been nullified.",

[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/160] \nPre-Conquest Events \nAccording to the terms of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Arab tribes were given the \noption to join either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraish, with which they desired \nto enter into treaty alliance. Should any of these tribes suffer aggression, then the \nparty to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu \nBakr joined Quraish, and Khuza‘ah joined the Prophet [pbuh]. They thus lived in \npeace for sometime but ulterior motives stretching back to pre-Islamic period ignited \nby unabated fire of revenge triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without caring a \nbit for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza‘ah in a place called Al-\nWateer in Sha‘ban, 8 A.H. Quraish helped Banu Bakr with men and arms taking \nadvantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah \nsought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary \nto all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chasing them in the \nsanctified area — where no blood should be shed — massacred his adversaries. When the aggrieved party sought justice from their Muslim allies, the Prophet \n[pbuh], as their leader, demanded an immediate redress for not only violating the \ntreaty but also slaying men allied to him in the sanctified area. Three demands were \nmade, the acceptance of any one of them was imperative: \na. to pay blood money for the victims of Khuza‘ah, \nb. to terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr; or \nc. to consider the truce to have been nullified.",

[Sahih Al-\nBukhari 1/450, 2/622] He immediately sent ‘Ali to make every possible reparation to \nthe tribes who had been wronged. After a careful inquiry, ‘Ali paid the blood-money \nto all those who suffered loss. The remaining portion was also distributed amongst \nthe members of the tribe in order to alleviate their suffering. Khalid, due to his \nirrational behaviour, had a row with ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf. Hearing this, the \nProphet [pbuh] got angry, and ordered Khalid to stop that altercation adding that his \nCompanions (meaning ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf) were too high in rank to be involved \nin such arguments. That is the story of the conquest of Makkah and the decisive battle that exterminated \npaganism once and for all.",

[Abu Da'ud] \nOn their way to Hunain they saw a great green Nabk plant, that was called Dhat-\nAnwat (the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their \nweapons on it, slay beasts under it and keep to it. So some of army members asked \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a Nabk with suspenders as the one \nthey had. \"Allâh is the Greatest of all!\" He said, \"I swear by the One in Whose Hand \nis Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him. They said ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people. These are Sunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who \npreceded you.\" [At-Tirmidhi] \nSeeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: \"We shall not be \ndefeated.\" Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. The Islamic Army stunned the Archers and the Attackers \nOn Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik \nbin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to \nhide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, narrow hiding \nplaces. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught \nsight of them and then to make a one-man attack against them. At early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and \ndistributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn the Muslims \nmoved towards Hunain Valley.

[Abu Da'ud] \nOn their way to Hunain they saw a great green Nabk plant, that was called Dhat-\nAnwat (the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their \nweapons on it, slay beasts under it and keep to it. So some of army members asked \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a Nabk with suspenders as the one \nthey had. \"Allâh is the Greatest of all!\" He said, \"I swear by the One in Whose Hand \nis Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him. They said ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people. These are Sunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who \npreceded you.\" [At-Tirmidhi] \nSeeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: \"We shall not be \ndefeated.\" Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. The Islamic Army stunned the Archers and the Attackers \nOn Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik \nbin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to \nhide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, narrow hiding \nplaces. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught \nsight of them and then to make a one-man attack against them. At early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and \ndistributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn the Muslims \nmoved towards Hunain Valley. They started descending into it unaware of the \npresence of an enemy lurking for them inside the valley. So at the moment they \nwere camping, arrows began showering intensively at them, whereas the enemy’s \nbattalions started a fierce attack against the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder \nand utter confusion.

Distribution delay was due to the Prophet’s hope that Hawazin’s delegation might \narrive and announce their repentance and consequently reclaim their loss. Seeing \nthat none of them arrived, he started dividing the booty so as to calm down the \ntribes’ chiefs and the celebrities of Makkah. The first to receive booty and the ones 264\nwho obtained the greatest number of shares were the people who had recently \nembraced Islam. Abu Sufyan bin Harb was given a hundred camels and forty (gold) ounces and yet he \nsaid, \"What about my son, Yazeed’s Share?\" So he was given the same quantity for \nhis son as well. But yet he exclaimed: \"And what about the share of Mu‘âwiyah, my \nsecond son?\" So the Prophet [pbuh] gave Mu‘âwiyah as much as he gave his father \nand brother. Hakeem bin Hizam was given a hundred camels, but he was given a \nhundred more when he demanded. Safwan bin Omaiyah was given three hundred \ncamels - a hundred camels at each time. It is thus mentioned in Shifâ’ [Ash-Shifa \n1/86], Book by Qadi Iyadh. The Prophet [pbuh] gave Al-Harith bin Harith bin Kilda a \nhundred camels. He also gave some chiefs of Quraish and other clans a hundred \ncamels; he gave others fifty and some others had forty. Eventually it was spread among people that \"Muhammad grants generously and \nfears not to grow poor.\" This made bedouins gather around him expecting to be \ngiven some wealth. They were so many that they forced the Prophet [pbuh] to seek \nrefuge against a tree and they even took away his garment, \"O people!\" He said, \n\"Give me back my garment! For I swear by the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s \nsoul, that if I had as many numerous camels as the number of Tihama trees, I would \ndistribute them among you. You know quite well that I am neither mean nor coward \nor a liar.\" Standing by his camel he plucked out a hair of his camel’s hump and held \nit between his two fingers, lifted it up and said: \"O people, I swear by Allâh that I get \nnothing but one-fifth of your booty, and this very fifth goes back to you.\" As soon as he had given the new converts, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered \nZaid bin Thabit to fetch the booty and summon people.

On his return, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] sent a party to demolish the \nnew structure. Particular News about the Byzantine and Ghassanide Preparations for War \nA magnified image of the prominent danger threatening the Muslims life was carried \nto them by the Nabateans who brought oil from Ash-Sham to Madinah. They carried \nnews about Heraclius’ preparations and equipment of an enormous army counting \nover forty thousand fighters besides Lukham, Judham and other tribes allied to the \nByzantines. They said that its vanguard had already reached Al-Balqâ’. Thus was the \ngrave situation standing in ambush for the Muslims. The general situation was \naggravated seriously by other adverse factors of too much hot weather, drought and \nthe rough and rugged distance they had to cover in case they decided to encounter \nthe imminent danger. The Messenger of Allâh’s [pbuh] concept and estimation of the situation and its \ndevelopment was more precise and accurate than all others. He thought that if he \ntarried or dealt passively with the situation in such a way that might enable the 274\nByzantines to paddle through the Islamic controlled provinces or to go as far as \nMadinah, this would — amid these circumstances — leave the most awful impression \non Islam as well as on the Muslims’ military credibility. The pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions (Al-Jahiliyah) which were at that time dying \nbecause of the strong decisive blow that they had already had at Hunain, could have \nhad a way to come back to life once again in such an environment. The hypocrites \nwho were conspiring against the Muslims so that they might stab them in the back \nwhereas Byzantines would attack them from the front. If such a thing came to light \nand they succeeded in their evil attempts, the Prophet and his Companions’ efforts to \nspread Islam would collapse and their profits which were the consequences of \nsuccessive and constant fights and invasions would be invalidated. The Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] realised all that very well. So — in spite of the hardships and drought \nthat Muslims were suffering from — the Prophet [pbuh] was determined that the \nMuslims should invade the Byzantines and fight a decisive battle at their own \nborders. He was determined not to tarry at all in order to thwart any Roman attempt \nto approach the land of Islam. When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had made up his mind and took his final \ndecision, he ordered his Companions to get ready for war and sent for the Makkans \nand the other Arab tribes asking for their assistance. Contrary to his habit of concealing his real intention of the invasion by means of \ndeclaring a false one, he announced openly his intention of meeting the Byzantines \nand fighting them.",

The general situation was \naggravated seriously by other adverse factors of too much hot weather, drought and \nthe rough and rugged distance they had to cover in case they decided to encounter \nthe imminent danger. The Messenger of Allâh’s [pbuh] concept and estimation of the situation and its \ndevelopment was more precise and accurate than all others. He thought that if he \ntarried or dealt passively with the situation in such a way that might enable the 274\nByzantines to paddle through the Islamic controlled provinces or to go as far as \nMadinah, this would — amid these circumstances — leave the most awful impression \non Islam as well as on the Muslims’ military credibility. The pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions (Al-Jahiliyah) which were at that time dying \nbecause of the strong decisive blow that they had already had at Hunain, could have \nhad a way to come back to life once again in such an environment. The hypocrites \nwho were conspiring against the Muslims so that they might stab them in the back \nwhereas Byzantines would attack them from the front. If such a thing came to light \nand they succeeded in their evil attempts, the Prophet and his Companions’ efforts to \nspread Islam would collapse and their profits which were the consequences of \nsuccessive and constant fights and invasions would be invalidated. The Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] realised all that very well. So — in spite of the hardships and drought \nthat Muslims were suffering from — the Prophet [pbuh] was determined that the \nMuslims should invade the Byzantines and fight a decisive battle at their own \nborders. He was determined not to tarry at all in order to thwart any Roman attempt \nto approach the land of Islam. When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had made up his mind and took his final \ndecision, he ordered his Companions to get ready for war and sent for the Makkans \nand the other Arab tribes asking for their assistance. Contrary to his habit of concealing his real intention of the invasion by means of \ndeclaring a false one, he announced openly his intention of meeting the Byzantines \nand fighting them.",

So when it was next morning and they still \nshowed disapproval to admit Allâh’s Words about ‘Isa or to embrace Islam, \nthe Prophet suggested Al-Mubahala that is each party should supplicate and \nimplore Allâh to send His Curse upon him or them if they were telling lies. After that suggestion of his, the Prophet [pbuh] came forward wrapping Al-\nHasan and Al-Husain under his garment whereas Fatimah was walking at his \nback. Seeing that the Prophet [pbuh] was serious and prepared to face them \nfirmly, they went aside and started consulting. Al-‘Aqib and As-Saiyid (i.e. the \nMaster) said to each other: \"We shall not supplicate. For, I swear by Allâh, if \nhe is really a Prophet and exchanges curses with us, we will never prosper \nnor will the descendants of ours. Consequently neither us nor our animals will \nsurvive it.\" Finally they made their mind to resort to the Messenger of Allâh’s \njudgement about their cause. They came to him and said: \"We grant you \nwhat you have demanded.\" The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] then admitted that \nagreement and ordered them to pay Al-Jizya (i.e. tribute) and he made peace \nwith them for the provision of two thousand garments, one thousand of them \nto be delivered in Rajab, the other thousand ones in Safar. With every \ngarment they had to pay an ounce (of gold). In return they will have the \ncovenant of Allâh and His Messenger. He gave them a covenant that provides \nfor practicing their religious affairs freely. They asked the Prophet [pbuh] to \nappoint a trustworthy man to receive the money agreed on for peace, so he \nsent them the trustworthy man of this nation Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah to \nreceive the amounts of money agreed on in the peace treaty. By the time Islam started to spread in Najran, naturally, they did not have to \npay Al-Jizya that usually non-Muslims paid.

The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started to develop certain symptoms that \nbespoke of leave-taking.

He was locked in the \nroom. On Tuesday, his body was washed with his clothes on. He was washed by Al-‘Abbas, \n‘Ali, Al-Fadl and Qathm — the two sons of Al-‘Abbas, as well as Shaqran — the \nMessenger’s freed slave, Osamah bin Zaid and Aws bin Khauli. Al-‘Abbas, Al-Fadl and \nQathm turned his body round, whereas Osamah and Shaqran poured out water. ‘Ali \nwashed him and Aws leant him against his chest. They shrouded him in three white Sahooli cotton cloth which had neither a headcloth \n[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/169; Sahih Muslim 1/306] nor a casing and inserted him in. A sort of disagreement arose with regard to a burial place. Abu Bakr said: \"I heard \nthe Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] say: ‘A dead Prophet is buried where he dies.’ So Abu \nTalhah lifted the bed on which he died, dug underneath and cut the ground to make \nthe tomb. People entered the room ten by ten. They prayed for the Prophet [pbuh]. The first to \npray for him were people of his clan. Then the Emigrants, then the Helpers. Women \nprayed for him after men. The young were the last to pray. This process took Tuesday long and Wednesday night (i.e. the night which precedes \nWednesday morning). ‘Aishah said: \"We did not know that the Prophet [pbuh] was \nbeing buried till we heard the sound of tools",

    "text": "n Abi Talib, and the marriage of \nhis two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that \nhe aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and \ngreat achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known. Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For \nthem a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the \nconsolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights \nagainst alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and \ndegradation to them. By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to demolish or \nbreak down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-\nWaleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the \nMessenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a \nshort time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.

Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For \nthem a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the \nconsolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights \nagainst alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and \ndegradation to them. By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to demolish or \nbreak down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-\nWaleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the \nMessenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a \nshort time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.

    "enhanced_text": "He is the most merciful, gentle and amiable to all people. His way of living is \nthe simplest one. Ill-manners and indecency are two qualities completely alien to \nhim. He was decent, and did not call anybody names. He was not the sort of person \nwho cursed or made noise in the streets. He did not exchange offences with others. He pushed back an offence or an error by forgiveness and overlooking. Nobody was \nallowed to walk behind him (i.e. He did not feel himself superior to \nothers not even to his slaves (men or women) as far as food or clothes were \nconcerned. Whoever served him should be served by him too. ‘Ugh’ (an utterance of complaint) \nis a word that had never been said by him to his servant; nor was his servant \nblamed for doing a thing or leaving it undone. Loving the poor and the needy and \nentertaining them or participating in their funerals were things the Prophet [pbuh] \nalways observed. He never contempted or disgraced a poor man for his poverty. Once he was travelling with his Companions and when it was time to have food \nprepared, he asked them to slaughter a she-sheep. A man said: I will slaughter it, \nanother one said: I will skin it out. A third said: I will cook it. So the Messenger of \nAllâh [pbuh] said: I will collect wood for fire. We will suffice you that \nwork.\" \"I know that you can do it for me, but I hate to be privileged. Allâh hates to \nsee a slave of his privileged to others.\" So he went and collected fire-wood. [Khulasa As-\nSiyar p.22] \nLet us have some of the description of Hind bin Abi Halah: \"The Messenger of Allâh \n[pbuh] was continually sad, thinking perpetually. He \nonly spoke when it was necessary. He would remain silent for a long time and \nwhenever he spoke, he would end his talk with his jawbone but not out of the \ncorners of his mouth, i.e. His speech was inclusive. 322\ninclusively and decisively.
