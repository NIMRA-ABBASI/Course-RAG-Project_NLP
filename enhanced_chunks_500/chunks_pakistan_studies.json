The country is divided into four provinces, each with its own assembly and Chief Minister, and two federally administered territories. This political structure was established after Pakistan gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. While this system of government provides for representation and decision-making at various levels, it has also been criticized for its failure to accommodate cultural diversity. In particular, the country's system of provincial and territorial division has been a source of tension between the different regions of Pakistan. For example, the province of Balochistan has long felt marginalized and neglected by the federal government, leading to ongoing political unrest and insurgency in the region. Similarly, the province of Sindh has a distinct cultural identity and history, and there have been calls for greater provincial autonomy and recognition of Sindhi cultural rights. However, the dominant Urdu-speaking elite in Pakistan has historically marginalized and suppressed Sindhi culture, leading to social and political tensions between the two groups.",

The constitution provides for a range of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech, religion, and association. However, these rights have often been restricted in practice, particularly in cases where they conflict with the dominant religious or cultural norms. For example, blasphemy laws in Pakistan have been used to restrict freedom of speech and expression, particularly for religious minorities. Similarly, the country's patriarchal cultural norms have led to restrictions on women's rights and autonomy, despite constitutional guarantees of equality. Language Diversity in Pakistan\nPakistan is a linguistically diverse country, with more than 74 languages spoken throughout the country. Urdu is the official language of Pakistan, and it is widely spoken and understood throughout the country. Other prominent languages spoken in Pakistan include Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Balochi, and Saraiki. The linguistic diversity in Pakistan is a reflection of the country's diverse ethnic groups, and each language has its unique cultural and historical significance. The linguistic diversity in Pakistan poses both challenges and opportunities for the country. On one hand, the diversity of languages in Pakistan creates a sense of pride and identity for the different ethnic groups. Each language represents a unique cultural heritage that is passed down from generation to generation. However, the linguistic diversity in Pakistan can also create barriers to communication and integration, as people who speak different languages may have difficulty understanding each other. Additionally, language can become a source of conflict when certain groups try to impose their language on others or when the government gives preference to one language over others.",

    "text": "Challenges and Opportunities of Cultural Diversity in Pakistan\nThe cultural diversity in Pakistan poses both challenges and opportunities for the country. On one hand, the country's cultural diversity is a source of pride and identity for its people. It is a reflection of the country's rich history and heritage, and it contributes to the country's cultural richness. However, cultural diversity can also create barriers to communication and integration. People who speak different languages or follow different customs and traditions may have difficulty understanding each other, which can lead to conflict and misunderstandings. One of the biggest challenges of cultural diversity in Pakistan is sectarianism and religious extremism. Pakistan has experienced several instances of sectarian violence in recent years, particularly between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Religious extremism has also been a significant challenge, with extremist groups promoting violence and intolerance towards minorities. These challenges have created a sense of insecurity among the people and have hindered the country's development. However, cultural diversity also presents significant opportunities for Pakistan. The country's diversity can be harnessed to promote social and economic development. The diversity of Pakistan's cultural heritage can be used to promote tourism and generate revenue for the country. Additionally, the country's diverse workforce can be harnessed to promote innovation and creativity in various fields, including business, science, and technology. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, Pakistan is a culturally diverse country that is rich in history and heritage. The country's cultural diversity is a reflection of its unique social, political, and economic context. The cultural elements of Pakistan, such as its language, religion, customs, and traditions, contribute to the country's identity and shape the lives of its people. The diversity of Pakistan's cultural heritage presents both challenges and opportunities for the country. The challenges of sectarianism and religious extremism must be addressed to harness the country's cultural diversity's full potential.

    "text": "The SDGs, providing a comprehensive long-term strategy for achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development. Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Globally, millions of people are still living on less than US$1.25 a day, many lacking access to adequate food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Women are more likely to live in poverty than men due to unequal access to paid work and education. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing access to basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people especially children have access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural practices: supporting small scale farmers and allowing equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity. Together with the other goals set out here, we can end hunger by 2030. The deaths can be avoided through prevention and treatment, education, immunization campaigns, and healthcare. The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to various diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage, and provide access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as well. QUALITY EDUCATION (SDG 4) Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high. Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development.

    "enhanced_text": "The SDGs, providing a comprehensive long-term strategy for achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development. Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Globally, millions of people are still living on less than US$1.25 a day, many lacking access to adequate food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Women are more likely to live in poverty than men due to unequal access to paid work and education. New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing access to basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people especially children have access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round. This involves promoting sustainable agricultural practices: supporting small scale farmers and allowing equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity. Together with the other goals set out here, we can end hunger by 2030. The deaths can be avoided through prevention and treatment, education, immunization campaigns, and healthcare. The Sustainable Development Goals make a bold commitment to various diseases like tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases by 2030. The aim is to achieve universal health coverage, and provide access to safe and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. Supporting research and development for vaccines is an essential part of this process as well.

GENDER EQUALITY (SDG 5) Ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, but it also crucial to accelerating sustainable development. It has been proven time and again, that empowering women and girls has a multiplier effect, and helps drive up economic growth and development across the board. The SDGs aim to build on these achievements to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere. WATER SCARCITY (SDG 6) Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, an alarming figure that is projected to increase with the rise of global temperatures as a result of climate change. By 2050, it is projected that at least one in four people will be affected by recurring water shortages. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires we invest in adequate infrastructure, provide sanitation facilities, and encourage hygiene at every level. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems such as forests, mountains, wetlands and rivers is essential if we are to mitigate water scarcity. More international cooperation is also needed to encourage water efficiency and support treatment technologies in developing countries. AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY (SDG 7) Ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 means investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. Adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies could also reduce the global electricity consumption. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment. DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (SDG 8) The SDGs promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this. With these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve full and productive employment, and decent work, for all women and men by 2030. INDUSTRY INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE (SDG 9) Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. Investment in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With over half the world population now living in cities, mass transport and renewable energy are becoming ever more important, as are the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies. Technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing new jobs and promoting energy efficiency. To end digital divide is to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.

REDUCED INEQUALITIES (SDG 10) Income inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide. These widening disparities require the adoption of sound policies to empower the bottom percentile of income earners, and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES (SDG 11) Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces, and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas.

It also involves investment in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive. More than half of the world's population now live in urban areas. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. The rapid growth of cities in the developing world, coupled with increasing rural to urban migration, has led to a boom in mega-cities.

A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs. Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological path by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use. The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal.

How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, and to counter balance the effects of climate change. Billions of people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. LIFE ON LAND (SDG 15) Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of our human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource and means of development. Forests account for 30 percent of the Earth's surface, providing vital habitats for millions of species and important sources for clean air and water; as well as being crucial for combating climate change. The SDGs aim to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, drylands and mountains by 2020. Halting deforestation is also vital to mitigating the impact of climate change. Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of our common heritage. PEACE JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS (SDG 16) Without peace, stability, human rights and effective governance, based on the rule of law, we cannot hope for sustainable development. We are living in a world that is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is by no means inevitable and must be addressed. High levels of violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a country's development, affecting economic growth. The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence, and work with governments and communities to find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity.

    "text": "Climate Change - Global Warming Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other air pollutants collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally this radiation would escape into space, but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. These heat-trapping pollutants specifically carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases are known as greenhouse gases, and their impact is called the greenhouse effect. Climate Change - Air pollution Air pollution is a major problem confronting Pakistan, with cities like Lahore and Karachi ranking among the most polluted worldwide. Climate Change - Deforestation There is growing recognition within the international community that deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries play a significant role as ‘cause and effect’ of climate change. When trees are growing, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but when they are destroyed they release all the carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere, causing global warming. Deforestation is responsible for about 20% of global warming. Various studies indicate that climate change is affecting, directly or indirectly, the flora and fauna as well as their habitats leading to their displacement and in most severe cases, even extinction. Climate change is also affecting the competitiveness of different species by differently altering their growth, mortality rates and regeneration success rates. This may adversely affect synchronous functioning of life cycles of plants, animals and soil organisms. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the international union for conservation of nature has rated the bird's status as \"endangered\". Ozone layer depletion Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, which is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders. UV rays also affect plant growth, reducing agricultural productivity.",

    "text": "Pakistan's economy is characterized by three main sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture has traditionally been a major sector, serving as the primary occupation for a significant portion of the population, providing food, raw materials for industries, and foreign exchange. It contributes substantially to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs a large part of the labor force. Key agricultural outputs include wheat, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables. The industrial sector is considered crucial for economic development and prosperity. Major industries include textiles (a significant export earner), sugar, cement, iron and steel, paper, defense production, fertilizers, and vehicle manufacturing. The services sector, which includes tourism, also plays a significant role in the economy. Natural resources are vital for Pakistan's economic stability. The country possesses considerable mineral resources such as iron ore, chromite, gypsum, coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium, which are essential for industrial activity and energy generation. Rivers like the Indus and its associated canal systems are the backbone of agriculture through irrigation and also provide hydroelectric power. Forests provide timber, fuel, and support biodiversity, while animal husbandry contributes milk, meat, wool, and serves as a source of foreign exchange. Effective management and utilization of these resources are key to the nation's development. Trade significantly impacts Pakistan's economic stability. Major exports include textiles, leather goods, sports goods, chemicals, carpets, rice, sugar, and cotton. However, Pakistan also relies heavily on imports such as petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizers, capital goods, and industrial raw materials. The country has faced chronic balance of payments problems, particularly due to the high cost of oil imports, which contributes to trade imbalances and current account deficits. Thus, managing the balance of trade is critical for economic stability.",

    "text": "Critically examine the key shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy after 9/11. Focus on Pakistan's relations with the US and India. The 9/11 terrorist attacks marked a watershed moment for Pakistan's foreign policy, leading to significant and complex shifts, particularly in its relations with the United States and India. Relations with the US: Immediately after 9/11, Pakistan became a crucial strategic ally for the United States in its \"War on Terror.\" This decision, as confessed by then-President Pervez Musharraf, was made under considerable pressure, as the US had threatened Pakistan if it did not cooperate. This alliance led to the lifting of US sanctions previously imposed on Pakistan and Pakistan being designated a major non-NATO ally. Pakistan played a key role in facilitating the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, permitting the transit of material across its territory. However, this relationship was fraught with challenges. The US often pressured Pakistan to \"do more\" to control Taliban militants and eliminate safe havens. A significant point of tension arose when the US launched a unilateral operation deep inside Pakistan. This operation resulted in the killing of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2011, further complicating bilateral ties. The Pak-US relationship during this period is described as \"complex, troublesome, and transactional,\" based on instrumental exchange rather than ideological affinity, and has been termed \"clientelistic.\" Despite common goals, priorities often differed, and Pakistan remained concerned about its territorial integrity. Relations with India: While Pakistan was deeply engaged with the US on its western border, its relationship with India remained tense, with the Kashmir dispute as the primary source of conflict. The post-9/11 global focus on counter-terrorism brought new dimensions to Indo-Pak relations. India often blamed Pakistan for initiating insurgency in Kashmir, equating it with terrorism. Although there were periods of attempted dialogue, the underlying distrust and conflict persisted. Events like the 2019 Pulwama attack, which India attributed to Pakistan-based militants, brought the two nuclear-armed neighbors to the brink of war. Furthermore, India's abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, which scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further sharpened tensions. The \"War on Terror\" dynamic sometimes saw increased international scrutiny on cross-border militancy, impacting Pakistan's leverage on the Kashmir issue.",

    "text": "Evaluate Pakistan's contribution to regional organizations like SAARC, ECO, or SCO. What are the challenges and opportunities in these alliances? Pakistan has been an active participant in several regional organizations, including the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), aiming to foster regional peace, stability, and economic development. In SAARC, Pakistan is a founding member and has advocated for frameworks to stimulate cooperation and progress in South Asia. The organization aims to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development among member states. Pakistan is also a founding member of ECO (originally RCD), which focuses on economic, technical, and cultural cooperation for sustainable development among its ten member states. More recently, Pakistan became a full member of the SCO in 2017. The SCO focuses on regional security, combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism, alongside regional development. Pakistan offers the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as an economic pathway for SCO member countries, enhancing its socio-economic objectives. A significant challenge, particularly within SAARC, is the persistent India-Pakistan rivalry, which has become a \"bottleneck\" hindering effective coordination and leading to the cancellation of summits. This has rendered SAARC largely ineffective in achieving its objectives, such as increasing intra-regional trade or significantly reducing poverty. For Pakistan, navigating relationships within these forums where India is also a member requires delicate diplomacy. Across all organizations, challenges include managing diverse national interests, lack of mutual trust among some members, internal political instability within member states, and resource constraints that can slow down the implementation of an organization's agenda. These regional organizations offer significant opportunities. ECO and SCO present brighter prospects for Pakistan for broader regional engagement, especially in Central Asia. SCO membership, in particular, allows Pakistan to contribute to regional security narratives and development alongside major players like China and Russia. Participation in SCO can also enhance Pakistan's worldwide socio-economic objectives, especially through initiatives like CPEC. These platforms provide avenues for dialogue on contentious issues, promotion of trade and investment, and collaboration on shared challenges like energy, environment, and connectivity. Successfully leveraging these alliances can help Pakistan strengthen its diplomatic ties, boost its economy, and play a more influential role in regional stability and prosperity. A flexible foreign policy and meaningful dialogue, particularly with neighbors, are crucial for Pakistan to maximize these opportunities.",

Unity: condition of the brotherhood of respecting each other, Urdu language, and religion. National cohesion: Urdu is an instrument, the common script of all languages. Integration: coordination of mental processes, Urdu national solidarity, common heritage, and struggle for freedom. Culture is defined as a human creation. It is the human part of the environment. Culture is the non-biological aspect of life. It is the process of generating and sharing meaning within a social system. This social system is comprised of values, norms, and ways of acting.

Meaning of Culture: Culture includes all the mental, spiritual and physical activities of a nation. It includes basic beliefs, ideas, values, customs, codes, institutions, tools, techniques, works of art, religions, and rituals dominant in a given society Religious Uniformity: Pakistan Culture is an Islamic Culture: Pakistan is an Ideological Islamic State. Its very existence is due to Islam, so Pakistani culture is primarily based on the Islamic way of life. All other ingredients of culture are inspired by Islam. Pakistani culture is highlighted by its grandeur, simplicity, firm convictions, and noble deeds and ideas. So, in the course of more than three decades of its existence, Pakistan has evolved a distinct culture of life of its own which is based on a distinct philosophy and values of life as articulated by Islam. 2- Mixed Culture: Pakistani culture is mixed culture although the majority of people are Muslims by birth and faith. But there is a great influence of Hindus and British culture on the present Pakistani society. Inhabitants of different provinces and areas of Pakistan have their values and traits. Food, clothes, languages, and traditions differ from one another. Punjabis, Sindhis, Balochis, Pathans, Brohis, Kashmiris Makranis, and Saraikis lead their respective cultural life but they are also connected with a common culture. 3- Dress: Dress is an important manifestation of culture.",

Bitter Experiences of Muslims Under the British Rule The coming of the British and their civilization that was at that time prevalent in the Western World had different repercussions among the various communities that made up the Indian Subcontinent, notably, Hindus and Muslims.

The partition of Bengal was the most important event during the rule of Lord Curzon. It was carried out mainly for the convenience of administration. Bengal in those days was the biggest province of India extending over 1,89,000 square miles with a population of almost 78 million. It was comprising of Bengal, Behar and Orissa and was under the central of one lieutenant Governor. After Lord Curzon took charge as Governor General of India the discussion over the Partition began. The first Partition of Bengal (1905) was a territorial reorganization of the Bengal Presidency implemented by the authorities of the British Raj. The reorganization separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The partition was supported by the Muslims of East Bengal and their support was motivated by both their poor economic conditions in East Bengal, as well as the believed dominance of the Hindu businessmen in West Bengal over the governance of Bengal.",

Both communities failed to reach any logical conclusion. On January 19, 1931, the first round table conference was officially finished.",

Now, what lay before them was the task of persuading their concerned masses to support them in the upcoming elections. But Muslim League, which stood for separate electorates, was unfortunately divided in several factions owing to personal and ideological differences. Congress, on the other hand, was raising slogans of joint electorates. Congress also wanted Hindi to be declared as the official language in the Deva Nagri script, while Muslims were in favour of Urdu in Persian script to be officially declared as the national language of the Indian sub-continent. The result of elections came as a huge shock to both the parties. Congress, who claimed to be representing 95% of the total Indian population, could not even secure 40% of the seats. It won almost 750 seats out of 1,771 in 8 out of 11 provinces. Its success was restricted to Hindu-majority provinces only. As for the results for the Muslim League, they were greatly disappointing. Out of 491 Muslim seats, it could only get 106 and 26 of them were taken by Congress. Hence, the final success of the elections was named in the favor of Congress, which gained majority in Bihar, Orissa, Madras and U.P and other regions. The Congress didn't set up ministries for about four months demanding British government to not interfere in its legislative affairs. Discussions between them took place, and at last, the British agreed without making any formal amendment to the Government of India Act 1935. As a result of which, Congress ministries were formed in July 1937 but with bitter policy against Muslims: Hindi became the national language, Congress flag became the national flag, and Bande Matram became the national anthem. A strict prohibition was laid on cow slaughter. The singing of Bande Matram, taken from the novel of Chandra Chatterji, was started in schools. Construction of new mosques was banned and Muslims were harassed while they offered prayers.",

He told a delegation of the Christian parliamentarians on 20th November 1942 that; 'If you help the Muslim League to make Pakistan, we will never forget you after Pakistan comes into existence, the Muslims will never forget your contribution. The Christian minority will be a sacred trust for us and the protection of their lives and properties will be part of our duties.' The Christian community in India felt closer to the All India Muslim League than the Congress, for a number of reasons. Mainly because as a representative of a minority community, the All India Muslim League understood the problems of Christian community much better. The second important reason was the trust the Christians had in the personality and ability of the Quaid e Azam to look after the interests of minorities in Pakistan. In his meeting with the Dewan Bahadr S.P Singha, the Christian leader and the speaker of the Punjab Assembly at that time, on 18th April 1947, he called on the Christians to raise their voices in favor of Pakistan and believed with the help of Punjab's Christians, Pakistan would become a reality. He said their help would be remembered by the Muslims generation after generation, as the Christians, who are people of Book, have a special affiliation with Muslims. Subsequently, appearing before the Boundary Commission on behalf of the Joint Christian Board, an umbrella organization consisting of four Christian organizations, Mr. Singha emphasized the Christians' feeling of affinity and solidarity with the Muslims. He said: 'Our people have been living with the Muslims for a long time. They trust the Muslims, they dress like Muslims... With Muslims they have a religious affinity.' The Christian leaders tried to include the whole of a Punjab into Pakistan. When it was impossible, they ensured that at least Western Punjab include into Pakistan, by all the Christian leaders voting in favor of Pakistan. When the vote was tied in the Punjab Assembly, Mr Singha, the speaker of the Punjab Assembly, cast his vote in favor of West Punjab and it became part of Pakistan. There were 88 votes which were going to merge the whole Punjab in India but Christian votes played a vital role and turned the game of Punjab in favor of Pakistan. Christian members and one additional vote of SP Singha as a Speaker of Legislative assembly of British India made a difference and Punjab merged in Pakistan.",

Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah in his address on 11 August 1947 highlighted the contributions of non-Muslim communities of Pakistan as \"The commendable services of religious minorities along with our Muslim brothers is a glorious chapter in the history of independence movement of Pakistan.\" He went on to state that there won't be any discrimination on the basis of caste or creed (belief) and all would be equal members of State. This unambiguous (clear) statement suggested that rights of minorities would be protected in Pakistan as being the majority Muslim country. This theme of equality was repeated again and again throughout his remaining short life. His choice of Mandal, as the first Law Minister is just one example out of that. On 11th October 1947, speaking to the officers of the Armed Forces he said one question which had been going around his head was the treatment of minorities. He said he would repeat it again and again in public and private statements that 'we will treat minorities with justice'. Quaid-e-Azam was of the view that Pakistan had been created for the Muslim minority in India, and it understood the trouble and sufferings of minorities. Therefore, it will treat its own minorities with justice, equality and respect, and will not only be accommodating but also be generous towards its own minorities. On 3rd February 1948 in Karachi, Quaid e Azam assured Parsi community that Pakistan would be true to its often repeated promises. He told them Pakistan is the fulfillment of dream of a nation which found itself a minority in the Indian sub-continent. Therefore Pakistan can never forget the minorities living within its borders.",

The Quaid e Azam did not forget minorities and at the Constituent Assembly on 11th August 1947, under the chairmanship of a Harijan, Joginder Singh Mandal. \"You are free to go to your temples.

It is then joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu, a flood control mechanism near Jhang and on moving further it merges with the Sutlej. River Ravi like many other rivers of the region, originates in the Himalayas. It's also called 'The river of Lahore' since the city of Lahore is located at Ravi's eastern bank.",

The 1962 constitution came into existence and was implemented on June 8, 1962 which introduced the Presidential form of Government. Salient Constitution of 1962 Written and Detailed Document\nThe 1962 constitution was written that consisted of 250 Articles and 3 Schedules. Thus it was comparatively detailed document. Keeping in view the lack of democratic values and established norms it was thought expedient to give a detailed code of constitutional law as could regulate the conduct of different political institutions. Incorporation of Objectives Resolution\nThe preamble of the 1962 constitution contained the Objectives Resolution 1949. Provision of parity of representation at the center\nAccording to the constitution, the central assembly (national assembly) would contain an equal number of representatives both from East and West Pakistan. There would be a total of 300 national assembly members, 150 from each unit. Federal System\nUnder the constitution of 1962 federal system was adopted. The powers of the central government were enumerated in the Federal List while all the residuary powers were given to the provinces so as to meet the demand of provincial autonomy. However, within this federal structure, the central government was made domineering even at the cost of provincial autonomy. Besides in the administrative matters, centralism was clearly reflected. The provincial governors were the appointees of President and accountable to him. Hence the provincial executive was under the control of the center. This centralism bore more disastrous results in respect of provincial autonomy. Consequently, the federal structure practically seemed unitary due to which the demand of provincial autonomy became more popular and widespread which threatened solidarity in the later stage. Presidential form of Government\nAccording to the 1962 constitution, it would be a presidential form of government in Pakistan. The president would be the head of the executive as well as the head of the state. The president enjoyed the power to issue ordinances that would take the shapes of law. No court and legislature would challenge presidential orders. The president could appoint and remove ministers and provincial governors. The president could veto any law made by the national assembly. Only a citizen of Pakistan with an age over 35 years would be eligible for the post of president. Presidential form of Government\nAll the executive authority was vested in the President who was unanimously responsible for the business of the central government. The president also enjoyed certain legislative, military and judicial powers. The provincial set up also followed the central structure. In short, it was the President who was all in all.",

Salient Constitution of 1962 Written and Detailed Document\nThe 1962 constitution was written that consisted of 250 Articles and 3 Schedules. Thus it was comparatively detailed document. Keeping in view the lack of democratic values and established norms it was thought expedient to give a detailed code of constitutional law as could regulate the conduct of different political institutions. Incorporation of Objectives Resolution\nThe preamble of the 1962 constitution contained the Objectives Resolution 1949. Provision of parity of representation at the center\nAccording to the constitution, the central assembly (national assembly) would contain an equal number of representatives both from East and West Pakistan. There would be a total of 300 national assembly members, 150 from each unit. Federal System\nUnder the constitution of 1962 federal system was adopted. The powers of the central government were enumerated in the Federal List while all the residuary powers were given to the provinces so as to meet the demand of provincial autonomy. However, within this federal structure, the central government was made domineering even at the cost of provincial autonomy. Besides in the administrative matters, centralism was clearly reflected. The provincial governors were the appointees of President and accountable to him. Hence the provincial executive was under the control of the center. This centralism bore more disastrous results in respect of provincial autonomy. Consequently, the federal structure practically seemed unitary due to which the demand of provincial autonomy became more popular and widespread which threatened solidarity in the later stage. Presidential form of Government\nAccording to the 1962 constitution, it would be a presidential form of government in Pakistan. The president would be the head of the executive as well as the head of the state. The president enjoyed the power to issue ordinances that would take the shapes of law. No court and legislature would challenge presidential orders. The president could appoint and remove ministers and provincial governors. The president could veto any law made by the national assembly. Only a citizen of Pakistan with an age over 35 years would be eligible for the post of president. Presidential form of Government\nAll the executive authority was vested in the President who was unanimously responsible for the business of the central government. The president also enjoyed certain legislative, military and judicial powers. The provincial set up also followed the central structure. In short, it was the President who was all in all.",

The president also enjoyed certain legislative, military and judicial powers. The provincial set up also followed the central structure. In short, it was the President who was all in all. Unicameral/One House Parliament\nThe 1962 Constitution provided unicameral legislature/one House Parliament at the center (the National Assembly) with an equal number of representatives from each province. Its total strength was raised upto 313, who were elected by the electoral college of Basic Democrats. Besides, certain seats were also reserved for women. Its term was 5 years, which was fixed. The members were elected on the basis of parity of representation between East and West wing. The proceedings of the Assembly might not be challenged in any court of law. Unlike the previous practices the members of the cabinet were not the members of the legislature. Indirect Selection\nIt was a new innovation in the 1962 constitution. It was a general impression that one of the causes of the failure of the constitutional machinery was the direct election without proper and necessary political education and training. Hence this constitution provided indirect method of election for President and for the legislative assemblies. Accordingly, the primary voters would elect the Basic Democrats who had then to elect the representatives to higher positions. Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy\nIn the original constitution there was no list of fundamental rights. It was due to the first amendment in the constitution in 1963 that these were included and made its part. The list of fundamental rights contained almost all the rights secured to its citizens by a modern state. The principles of policy were also incorporated in the constitution. Most of the Islamic provisions were made the part thereof. These principles of policy dealt with such matters as Islamic way of life, national integration and solidarity, social welfare, protection of the rights of minorities, development of backward areas etc. Although the 1962 constitution of Pakistan had transferred several responsibilities to the provincial governments but in actual practice the central government or its representatives used to exercise these powers.",

Agricultural lands hold key to development and prosperity of a country. The rate of development and prosperity of a country depends on efforts to make use of it. Effective management and human efforts are needed to avail them. Modern technology is also required to make use of it. Natural Resources - Minerals Pakistan is blessed with considerable mineral resources. Some of them are explored but much remains to be done for the search for more. Some important resources are discussed here. Natural Resources - Minerals: Iron Ore Iron Ore is used for industry, especially steel industry. Iron ore is found in various regions of Pakistan including Nokundi, Chiniot, Kalabagh the largest one, Haripur and other northern areas. Iron ore is among the top five minerals found in Pakistan. The Kalabagh iron deposit is one of the largest in the country. In February 2015, reserves were found in Chiniot, around 160 kilometres northwest of Lahore, by a Chinese group, the Metallurgical Cooperation of China. Natural Resources - Minerals: Chromites Chromites is used in preparing other metals, leather tanning, making of steel products, armament and stainless steel. Sizable deposits of this mineral are found at Muslimbagh, district Killa Saifullah. Lasbela, Khuzdar, Kharan and Chaghi districts have chromite reserves. Private sector has been engaged in mining this mineral. Natural Resources - Minerals: Gypsum Gypsum is used for plaster of Paris, Paints and Cement. The main Gypsum deposits occur in the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan District. The deposits occur in the north-south trending ridges that form the foot-hills of the Suleman Range, West of Dera Ghazi Khan. Natural Resources - Minerals: Coal Pakistan has coal deposits in Sindh, Punjab and Baluchistan. The total coal resources of Pakistan are reported to be approximately 185 Billion tons. Coal is used in power generation. It is basically used as fuel. Natural Resources - Minerals: Oil and Gas Oil: Pakistan remains an importer of refined oil because of the low capacity of domestic refineries to process crude oil. It is a major source of energy. It is mostly imported from Iran and Gulf states. Gas: It is itself a source of energy and fuel, and also used as a source of power generation.",

We have a canal system and the most important one is the Indus Basin project. What we require is the proper management of water, its conservation, effective use, storage, dams and flood control. Pakistan linked its rivers through a canal-link system. Pakistan's irrigation system, built by the British in the 1800s, is a complex network that brings water from the rivers to the canals and, in turn, through distributaries. The Indus Basin Project is a water control project that resulted from a treaty, Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 that guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River independent from upstream control by India. Indus Waters Treaty was signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan. Water is dangerous if it is too much, it become a problem if it is too little.

Rivers: Specific Descriptions Indus River is taken to be one of the longest rivers in Asia. The Indus river is the longest river in Pakistan, originating from the Himalayan region. The Indus River fulfils the water requirements of Pakistan and is the main support for agriculture.

Sugar: Pakistan has made tremendous progress in this industry. It is a food item, located in Sindh and Punjab. Cement: This industry has gone through major expansion. Over 20 factories are established in the public and private sectors which cater to Pakistani needs. Still it is imported in limited quantity. Vegetable Ghee: Cooking oil is a major food item. There is much expansion over the years both in private and public sectors although some raw material for making cooking oil is imported. Iron and Steel: Steel Mill near Karachi was set up and major problem was that of raw material. The iron ore found in Pakistan is very poor in quality. Steel rolling units and iron related factories exist in different parts of Pakistan. Paper: Major paper industry was in East Pakistan, which was lost in 1971. We had to face shortage of locally made paper after 1971. Now this industry is located in Noshera, Charsada, Gujranwala, Lahore, and Gharo. Some quality paper has to be imported. Machine, tools: Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) Taxila serve this purpose. HMC was set up with Chinese cooperation. Machinery, industrial equipment, engineering goods, engines, machinery for sugar, cement, and fertilizer industry is prepared here. Defence Industry: Wah Ordinance Complex is established for armaments. Other Important Industry: Fertilizer, Tobacco and cigarettes, Oil Refineries, Cars and Tractors production, Shipbuilding: Karachi Shipyard. Cottage Industry: Industries established on small scale, involving a household or small number of people, use of limited resources, having less investment are called small or cottage industries e. g., Carpets, sports goods, toys, handicraft etc.",

    "text": "Imports & Exports in Pakistan The major exports of Pakistan include textiles, leather and sports goods, chemicals, carpets, and rugs. Meanwhile, Pakistan also exports significant quantities of rice, sugar, cotton, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Imports include petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, fertilizer, capital goods (goods that are used in producing other goods, rather than being bought by consumers), industrial raw materials, and consumer products. Capital goods are physical assets that a company uses in the production process to manufacture products and services that consumers will later use. Capital goods include buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and tools. Capital goods are not finished goods, instead, they are used to make finished goods. Trade consists of two basic components: exports and imports. Balance of Trade formula = Country's Exports – Country's Imports. Positive trade balance signifies a trade surplus, while a negative value signifies a trade deficit. Pakistan's payments problems have been chronic since the 1970s, with the cost of oil imports primarily responsible for the trade imbalance. Increased imports and softer demand for Pakistan's textiles and apparel in major markets also caused the current account deficit to further increase.

Towering mountains, beautiful lakes, turquoise waters, and the world's highest baseball field are the salient features of Skardu. The destination is the home to the second-highest plateau on the planet Deosai National Park, often referred to as the roof of the world, sprawling on an area of 4,117 metres.

The Kalash Valleys, comprised of Bumboret, Rumbur, and Birir, are home to the Kalash people, a religious and ethnic minority in Pakistan with their own beliefs, culture and language. The valleys they live in are certainly some of the most beautiful places in Pakistan not just for their natural splendor, but also for the beauty of the Kalash themselves. The valley of Rumbur is particularly stunning. Here, kilometers of dusty road and mountains rumble alongside the Kalash River. The Kalash people live in wooden homes that cling to the high hills, and the women are particularly famous for their brightly-colored traditional dress and headwear that differs from anything else one can find in Pakistan.

The relations have been strained since independence in 1947. There were periods of normal relations but generally it remained troubled marked with distrust and conflict. This bitterness caused three major wars in 1947-48, 1965 and 1971. Limited conflicts and trouble at LoC (Line of Control) along with propaganda war are common practices. Tensions escalate when the troops on the border from both sides face each other. But with bilateral dialogue there is a hope on Kashmir and other issues. It is the only way to bring prosperity and peace for people of South Asia. The Pakistan India relations are one of the most complex associations of its neighboring countries. The two countries share linguistic, cultural, geographical and economic links but due to political and historical reasons, the relations are tense. 1947 – Britain, as part of its pullout from the Indian subcontinent, divides it into secular but mainly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan on August 15 and 14 respectively. The partition causes one of the largest human migrations ever seen and sparks riots and violence across the region. Main source of conflict between India and Pakistan is Kashmir dispute. It should be resolved under the UN Resolutions. But India has declared it as integral part of it. Instead of having plebiscite, has blamed Pakistan for initiating insurgency in Kashmir. India claims that it is engineered by Pakistan and equates this with terrorism. The first India-Pakistan war over Kashmir is fought, after armed tribesmen (lashkars) from Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province (now called Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) invade the disputed territory in October 1947. The Maharaja, faced with an internal revolt as well an external invasion, requests the assistance of the Indian armed forces, in return for acceding to India. He hands over control of his defence, communications and foreign affairs to the Indian government",

That referendum has yet to be held. The region of Kashmir is one of the most unstable areas in the world. The nations of India and Pakistan have fiercely contested each other over Kashmir. The conflict that started after the partition of India in 1947 as both India and Pakistan claimed the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a dispute over the region that escalated into wars between India and Pakistan and several other armed skirmishes. It has gained immense international attention given the fact that both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers and this conflict represents a threat to global security. The British, led by the then Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, divided the British India empire into the states of India and Pakistan. The British India Empire was made up of multiple princely states (states that were allegiant to the British but headed by a monarch) along with states directly headed by the British. At the time of the partition, princely states had the right to choose whether they were to cede to India or Pakistan. In general, the Muslim majority states went to Pakistan while the Hindu majority states went to India, although India was a secular nation. Kashmir was a peculiar case. While the majority of the population was Muslim, the ruler was a Hindu, Maharaja Hari Singh. However, this was not the only such case. The state of Junagadh was also faced with such a conflict. The ruler of Junagadh was a Muslim, who wished to accede to Pakistan, against the wishes of his people. Mountbatten recommended that Junagadh should go to India not only because it was a largely populated state but also because it was completely surrounded by India. However, the ruler relinquished to Pakistan. India, enraged, taken over Junagadh. However, when it came to the region of Kashmir, the situation unfolded differently. Although Kashmir was a Muslim majority state headed by a Hindu ruler, Mountbatten recommended that Kashmir should go to India. But Hari Singh decided that Kashmir would be independent, at least for a while, because he feared that the Kashmiri Muslims would not be happy with India while the Hindus and Sikhs would not be happy in Pakistan. During this period of ambivalence in Kashmir, there were outbursts of riots in certain districts of Kashmir against the ruler.",

    "text": "Significance (Kashmir Issue) The primary reason for this conflict between the two nations is due to how valuable Kashmir is in terms of national security, geography and resources. The largely important Indus River flows through Kashmir. The Indus River is extremely crucial to agriculture in Pakistan. It is especially important in the lower Indus valley region, where rainfall is uncommon. Similarly, India depends on the Indus for irrigation. Hence, the Indus and its tributaries are highly sought after. The nation that controls this region effectively can cut off the water supply to the other. To manage these fears and ensure a fair distribution of the water from this river, the Indus Water Treaty came into existence on the 19th of September, 1960. Under this treaty, India has control over the eastern tributaries of Beas, Ravi and Sutlej, while Pakistan has control over the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. There has also been a surge of Indian nationalism lately, especially with the nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party coming to power in 2014 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the helm. From a geopolitical standpoint, Kashmir is vital as well. It is certain that thousands of Kashmiri’s and soldiers have faced and continue to face atrocities. There are also reports of human rights violations in the region. In both Pakistan and India there is increasing sympathy for the Kashmiris. However, at the current moment, there is little hope for change in this region.",

    "text": "Abrogation of Article 370 On August 05, 2019, India re-annexed Kashmir by scrapping so-called special status under Article 370 and 35A of Indian constitution. These 2 articles of Indian constitution granted Jammu and Kashmir region under India a certain amount of autonomy including its own constitution, a separate flag, and authority to make laws. The people of Jammu and Kashmir could make their own laws relating to permanent residency, ownership of property, and fundamental rights. These laws also barred non-Kashmiri Indians from outside the province from purchasing property or settling there. Although since 1953, India had slowly and steadily weakened the nature of autonomy granted under these two articles. The implementation of the abrogation of Article 370 is a threat to the democracy. It is an attempt to polarize and appease the Hindu population in the valley. After the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region was bifurcated into two centrally-administered Union Territories (UTs) specifically UT of Jammu and Kashmir and UT of Ladakh. India shares borders with China in Ladakh. And the step is being seen as India’s move to settle border disputed with Beijing. After bifurcation (the division of something into two branches or parts. ), the disputed region came directly under the so-called federal (central) government of India. The two nuclear-armed South Asian nations have fought three wars since they became free nations in 1947, and remain deeply distrustful of each other. Tension has sharpened since August 2019 when India ended the autonomy of its only Muslim-majority region, Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan",
